   as well as support for the "primary" clipboard on X11 and wayland (select to copy, and middle click to paste).

### Rust

 - Minimum Rust version is now 1.66.
 - **Breaking:** Deprecated functions and enums were removed from the API.
 - **Breaking:** `PointerEventButton::None` was renamed `PointerEventButton::Other`
 - **Breaking:** More functions now return `Result`, and the return value needs to be `unwrap()`'ed.
 - **Breaking:** A lifetime parameter was added to `slint::ModelPeer`.
 - **Breaking:** `StandardListViewItem` and `TableColumn` are now marked as `#[non_exhaustive]`.
 - **Breaking:** Removed the `stride()` function from `slint::Image` - use `width()` instead.
 - **Breaking:** In `slint::platform::WindowEvent::KeyPressed` and `KeyReleased`, the `text` field is now
   a `slint::SharedString`.
 - **Breaking:** `slint::platform::WindowEvent` does not derive from `Copy` anymore. You must `clone()` it

### C++

 - Functions that take a functor as argument are now using C++ 20 concepts.
 - **Breaking:** In the C++ API, the type for row indexes in models was changed from `int` to `size_t`.
   This includes arguments of virtual functions in `slint::Model` that needs to be adjusted in
   derived classes.

   Callbacks and functions can be annotated with `pure`.
 - On an `Image`, the default value of `source-clip-width` and `source-clip-height` is now set to
   the size of the image minus the `source-clip-{x,y}`. The source clip size is now used to compute

   old name continues to work.
 - The style or the backend now always set a value for the `Window`'s `default-font-size` property.
 - In the Rust API, the `GraphicsAPI`'s `NativeOpenGL` variant uses a function signature for `get_proc_address` that
   takes a `&std::ffi::CStr` instead of a `&str` to match the native APIs and avoid unnecessary conversions.

### Added

   of `slint_interpreter::Weak<slint_interpreter::ComponentInstance>`.
 - For the Rust API crate, the Rust Interpreter API crate, the `backend-gl`, `x11`, and `wayland` features were renamed to `backend-gl-all`, `backend-gl-x11`, and `backend-gl-wayland`.
 - For the C++ CMake interface, the `SIXTYFPS_BACKEND_GL`, `SIXTYFPS_FEATURE_X11`, and `SIXTYFPS_FEATURE_WAYLAND` options were renamed to `SLINT_BACKEND_GL_ALL`, `SLINT_FEATURE_BACKEND_GL_X11`, and `SLINT_FEATURE_BACKEND_GL_WAYLAND`.

   instead.
 - Fixed angle conversion for values specified in radians, gradians and turns.

## [0.1.0] - 2021-06-30

### Changed

 - Layouts are now conceptually their own elements, meaning that the `x` and `y` properties of items
   within layouts are relative to the layout and no longer to the parent element of layouts.
 - The default spacing and padding of layouts is now 0 instead of being specific to the style.
   There are now `HorizontalBox`, `VerticalBox`, `GridBox` widgets which have default spacing and padding.
 - Setting the window `height` and `width` properties results in a fixed size. The `preferred-width`
   and `preferred-height` property can be used to set the initial size and the window remains resizable
   by the user, if the window manager permits.
 - Binding loops are now detected at compile-time instead of panic at runtime.
 - The `viewer` binary was renamed to `slint-viewer` and is now available via `cargo install` from crates.io.
 - The layout properties `minimum-width`, `maximum-height`, etc. were renamed to a shorter version `min-width`,
   `max-height`. The old names are still supported as a deprecated alias.

### Added

 - Warnings are now shown in the online code editor.
 - `sixtyfps::invoke_from_event_loop` was added to the C++ and Rust APIs, to run a function in the UI thread from any thread.
 - `sixtyfps::run_event_loop()` and `sixtyfps::quit_event_loop()` were added to the Rust and C++ APIs to start and quit the main event loop.
 - `z` property on items.
 - The type in two-way bindings can now be omitted.
 - It's possible to declare aliases for callbacks (`callback clicked <=> other.clicked;`)
 - `abs()` function to get the absolute value
 - The root element of an `if` or `for` can be given a name (`if (condition) name := Rectangle {}`)
 - `sixtyfps::Image` is a new type in the public Rust and C++ API to load images from a path.
 - The width and height of images is now accessible via the `width`or `height` of an `image` type property in .60 files (`some-image.source.width`)

### Fixed

 - Fixed Mouse wheel to work on the `Flickable` element and derivatives.
 - Fixed generated C++ code on Windows.
 - Calling `debug(...)` no longer breaks the LSP.
 - `ComponentDefinition::properties` only exposes public properties as documented.
 - Many more bugfixes

## [0.0.6] - 2021-04-27

### Changed
 - `Rectangle::color` was deprecated and replaced by `Rectangle::background`, same for `Window::color`
 - `Path::fill-color` was renamed to `fill`, and `Path::stroke-color` was renamed to `stroke`, which are now brushes instead of color
 - Many other color property became brush in order to support gradients
 - the `resource` type was renamed to `image`
 - Calling a callback is done from C++/Rust with `invoke_<name>` instead of `call_<name>`

### Added
 - `@linear-gradient` can be used to have gradients on rectangle and paths
 - `Image::colorize` allows to apply a color filter on image
 - `0` can be converted to anything with units
 - Support power of unit in intermediate expression. (eg: `3px * width / height` is now supported but used to be an error)
 - Support for `else if`
 - The path fill rule can now be specified using `Path::fill-rule`.
 - Support for `letter-spacing` in `Text`/`TextInput` elements.
 - `rgb()` / `rgba()`
 - Layout in Flickable
 - LSP server with Live Preview and basic auto completion
 - The viewer tool gained the `--auto-reload` argument
 - `Window.default-font-weight`
 - Added `opacity` property that can be applied to elements
 - Added `clip` property in Rectangle, including clipping for rounded rectangle
 - API to load dynamically .60 files from C++ and Rust, including a way to embed sixtyfps widgets in Qt applications
 - Preferred size in Layouts
 - Math functions such as `sin`, `cos`, `sqrt`, ...
 - New printer demo design
 - Ability to load custom fonts using `import` statements

### Fixed
 - `Image::image-fit`'s `cover` and `contains` variant are fixed to match the CSS spec
 - Flickable without scrollbar
 - Multiplying and dividing different units.
 - Many more bugfixes

## [0.0.5] - 2021-01-29

### Changed
 - Renamed "signal" to "callback"
 - And calling a callback is done from C++/Rust with `call_<name>` instead of `emit_<name>`
 - Renamed "SharedArray" to "SharedVector" in the C++/Rust API
 - Renamed Slider min and max property to minimum and maximum
 - The graphics rendering backend was changed to use femtovg or Qt
 - Renamed `initial-focus` to `forward-focus` as focus related property on elements
 - The "align-" prefix was removed from `TextHorizontalAlignment` and `TextVerticalAlignment`. Either
   change `align-left` to `left` or qualify with `TextHorizontalAlignment.left`.
 - `img!"..."` is replaced by `@image-url("...")`
 - `$children` is replaced by `@children`

### Added
 - `title` property to the Window element
 - `color` property to the Window element
 - `maximum`/`minimum` properties to the `SpinBox`

 - Fixed disabled widgets

## [0.0.3] - 2020-12-09

### Changed
 - In C++, the generated component is now wrapped by a `ComponentHandle` smart pointer that acts like `std::shared_ptr`. New instances
   are created using `T::create()`.
 - In Rust, the generated component implements `Clone` and acts like an `Rc`. `sixtyfps::Weak` can be used to hold weak references.
 - `ARGBColor` was renamed `RgbaColor`
 - `width and `height` of some builtin elements now default to 100% of the parent element.

### Added
 - Allow dashes in identifiers (#52)
 - VerticalLayout / HorizontalLayout

 - Added a `current_item` to `StandardListView`.
 - API cleanup in sixtyfps-node

### Fixed
 - Fix occasional hang when navigating in `TextInput` fields with the cursor keys.
