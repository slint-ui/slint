# Changelog
All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [Unreleased]

### Changed

 - Layout are now conceptually their own elements, meaning that the x and y property of items
   within layout are relative to the layout and no longer to the parent element of layouts.
 - Setting the window `height` and `width` property are now fixed size. The `preferred-width`
   and `preferred-height` property can be used to set the initial size.
 - Binding loop detection at compile-time instead of panic at runtime
 - Renamed the `viewer` binary to `sixtyfps-viewer` and published it on crates.io
 - Renamed `minimum-width`, `maximum-height`, ... to a shorter version `min-width`, `max-height`.
   The old name is kept as a deprecated alias.

### Added

 - Show warnings in the online code editor
 - C++ and Rust API to run a function in the UI thread from any thread
 - `z` property on items
 - Mouse wheel work on the Flickable and derivatives
 - One can now omit the type of a two way binding property
 - One can declare callback aliases
 - `abs()` function to get the absolute value
 - Ability to name the root element of an `if` or `for`
 - `sixtyfps::Image` is part of the public API in rust and C++
 - one can access to the `width`or `height` of an `image` from the .60 files

### Fixed

 - Fixed C++ backend on windows
 - `debug(...)` no longer break the LSP
 - ComponentDefinition::properties only expose public properties as documented
 - Many more bugfixes


## [0.0.6] - 2021-04-27

### Changed
 - `Rectangle::color` was deprecated and replaced by `Rectangle::background`, same for `Window::color`
 - `Path::fill-color` was renamed to `fill`, and `Path::stroke-color` was renamed to `stroke`, which are now brushes instead of color
 - Many other color property became brush in order to support gradients
 - the `resource` type was renamed to `image`
 - Calling a callback is done from C++/Rust with `invoke_<name>` instead of `call_<name>`

### Added
 - `@linear-gradient` can be used to have gradients on rectangle and paths
 - `Image::colorize` allows to apply a color filter on image
 - `0` can be converted to anything with units
 - Support power of unit in intermediate expression. (eg: `3px * width / height` is now supported but used to be an error)
 - Support for `else if`
 - The path fill rule can now be specified using `Path::fill-rule`.
 - Support for `letter-spacing` in `Text`/`TextInput` elements.
 - `rgb()` / `rgba()`
 - Layout in Flickable
 - LSP server with Live Preview and basic auto completion
 - The viewer tool gained the `--auto-reload` argument
 - `Window.default-font-weight`
 - Added `opacity` property that can be applied to elements
 - Added `clip` property in Rectangle, including clipping for rounded rectangle
 - API to load dynamically .60 files from C++ and Rust, including a way to embed sixtyfps widgets in Qt applications
 - Preferred size in Layouts
 - Math functions such as `sin`, `cos`, `sqrt`, ...
 - New printer demo design
 - Ability to load custom fonts using `import` statements

### Fixed
 - `Image::image-fit`'s `cover` and `contains` variant are fixed to match the CSS spec
 - Flickable without scrollbar
 - Multiplying and dividing different units.
 - Many more bugfixes

## [0.0.5] - 2021-01-29

### Changed
 - Renamed "signal" to "callback"
 - And calling a callback is done from C++/Rust with `call_<name>` instead of `emit_<name>`
 - Renamed "SharedArray" to "SharedVector" in the C++/Rust API
 - Renamed Slider min and max property to minimum and maximum
 - The graphics rendering backend was changed to use femtovg or Qt
 - Renamed `initial-focus` to `forward-focus` as focus related property on elements
 - The "align-" prefix was removed from `TextHorizontalAlignment` and `TextVerticalAlignment`. Either
   change `align-left` to `left` or qualify with `TextHorizontalAlignment.left`.
 - `img!"..."` is replaced by `@image-url("...")`
 - `$children` is replaced by `@children`

### Added
 - `title` property to the Window element
 - `color` property to the Window element
 - `maximum`/`minimum` properties to the `SpinBox`
 - strings can contain escape codes
 - `FocusScope` to handle key events
 - `return` statements
 - `Text` word wrap and elide
 - `drop-shadow-*` properties (limited to `Rectangle` at the moment)
 - `Color.brighter` / `Color.darker`
 - `Window.default-font-family` and `Window.default-font-size`


## [0.0.4] - 2020-12-14

### Changed
 - Changed Rust `build.rs` API to use an opaque compiler configuration type
 - With Rust, image resources are embedded in the binary by default.
 - Updated winit version
 - Updated Neon Version

### Fixed
 - Fixed animations sometimes stopping mid-way.
 - Fixed rendering of C++ components
 - Fixed disabled widgets

## [0.0.3] - 2020-12-09

### Changed
 - In C++, the generated component is now wrapped by a `ComponentHandle` smart pointer that acts like `std::shared_ptr`. New instances
   are created using `T::create()`.
 - In Rust, the generated component implements `Clone` and acts like an `Rc`. `sixtyfps::Weak` can be used to hold weak references.
 - `ARGBColor` was renamed `RgbaColor`
 - `width and `height` of some builtin elements now default to 100% of the parent element.

### Added
 - Allow dashes in identifiers (#52)
 - VerticalLayout / HorizontalLayout
 - Placeholder text in `LineEdit`
 - global components (#96)
 - `Clip` element
 - `ComboBox` element
 - `PopupWindow` element
 - `Image` element: New source-clip-{x, y, width, height} properties
 - `sixtyfps::Timer` in Rust API
 - Transitions are now implemented
 - `round`/`ceil`/`floor`/`mod`/`max`/`min`/`cubic-bezier` functions
 - Signals can have return a value
 - `has_hover` property in `TouchArea`
 - `font-weight` property on Text
 - `viewbox-x/y/width/height` and `clip` properties for `Path`


## [0.0.2] - 2020-10-22

### Changed
 - Default to the native style in the `viewer`, if available.
 - Changed the name of the common logical pixel unit from `lx` to `px`. The less
   often used physical pixel has now the `phx` suffix.

### Added
 - Add support for more keyboard shortcuts to `TextInput`.
 - Added a `current_item` to `StandardListView`.
 - API cleanup in sixtyfps-node

### Fixed
 - Fix occasional hang when navigating in `TextInput` fields with the cursor keys.
 - Fix access to aliased properties from within `for` and `if` expressions.
 - Fix `ScrollView` being scrollable when it shouldn't.
 - Fix appearance of natively styled scrollars.
 - Allow converting an object type to another even if it is missing some properties.
 - Add missing frame drawing around `ScrollView`.
 - Fix Clipping in scroll views in WASM builds.
 - Fix resizing of `ListView`.
 - Many more bugfixes
