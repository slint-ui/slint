### Rust

 - Minimum Rust version is now 1.66.
 - **Breaking:** Deprecated functions and enums were removed from the API.
 - **Breaking:** `PointerEventButton::None` was renamed `PointerEventButton::Other`
 - **Breaking:** More functions now return `Result`, and the return value needs to be `unwrap()`'ed.

   Callbacks and functions can be annotated with `pure`.
 - On an `Image`, the default value of `source-clip-width` and `source-clip-height` is now set to
   the size of the image minus the `source-clip-{x,y}`. The source clip size is now used to compute
   the default aspect ratio of the image.

   invoke functions in addition to callbacks.
 - Warn if the last component or singleton in a file is implicitly marked for exporting.

### Added

 - `StandardTableView` widget.

   old name continues to work.
 - The style or the backend now always set a value for the `Window`'s `default-font-size` property.
 - In the Rust API, the `GraphicsAPI`'s `NativeOpenGL` variant uses a function signature for `get_proc_address` that
   takes a `&std::ffi::CStr` instead of a `&str` to match the native APIs and avoid unnecessary conversions.

### Added

## [0.2.0] - 2022-02-10

This version changes some APIs in incompatible ways. For details how to migrate your application code, see the [C++ migration guide](api/cpp/docs/cpp_migration.md)
as well as the [Rust migration guide for the `sixtyfps` crate](api/rs/slint/migration.md) and for the
[`slint-interpreter` crate](internal/interpreter/migration.rs).

### Changed

 - Minimum rust version is now 1.56
 - C++ compiler requires C++20
 - In the C++ interpreter API `std::span` is used for callbacks arguments, instead of `sixtyfps::Slice`
 - `Model::row_data` will now return a `Option<T>` / `std::optional<T>` instead of a plain `T`.
 - `Model::model_tracker` no longer has a default implementation.
 - The deprecated methods `Model::attach_peer` and `ModelNotify::attach` were removed.
 - The interpreter does not differentiate anymore between `Value::Array` and `Value::Model`
   everything is a `Value::Model`, which now contains a `ModelRc`
 - In Rust, `slint::SharedPixelBuffer` and `slint::SharedImageBuffer` now use a `u32` instead of `usize` for `width`, `height` and `stride`.
 - In Rust and C++, `slint::Image::size()` now returns an integer size type.
 - `sixtyfps::interpreter::CallCallbackError` was renamed to `slint::interpreter::InvokeCallbackError`
 - Some deprecation warning in .60 became hard errors
 - Replace `ModelHandle` with `ModelRc`
 - `slint::interpreter::ComponentInstance` in Rust now implements `slint::ComponentHandle`. This removes `sixtyfps_interpreter::WeakComponentInstance` in favor
   of `slint_interpreter::Weak<slint_interpreter::ComponentInstance>`.
 - For the Rust API crate, the Rust Interpreter API crate, the `backend-gl`, `x11`, and `wayland` features were renamed to `backend-gl-all`, `backend-gl-x11`, and `backend-gl-wayland`.
 - For the C++ CMake interface, the `SIXTYFPS_BACKEND_GL`, `SIXTYFPS_FEATURE_X11`, and `SIXTYFPS_FEATURE_WAYLAND` options were renamed to `SLINT_BACKEND_GL_ALL`, `SLINT_FEATURE_BACKEND_GL_X11`, and `SLINT_FEATURE_BACKEND_GL_WAYLAND`.
 - The animation `loop-count` property was replaced by `iteration-count` (which is the same as `loop-count` plus one)

### Added

 - `TextEdit::font-size` and `LineEdit::font-size` have been added to control the size of these widgets.
 - Added `slint::Window::set_rendering_notifier` to get a callback before and after a new frame is being rendered.
 - Added `slint::Window::request_redraw()` to schedule redrawing of the window contents.

### Fixed

 - Models initialized from arrays are now also mutable when run in the interpreter.
 - Fixed compilation error when accessing object members of array through the array index syntax

## [0.1.6] - 2022-01-21

### Changed

 - **Breaking:** The internal key code for the keys left, right, home and end
   has changed. This was undocumented, but if you were handling this in the
   `FocusScope` event, these keys will now be ignored. Use the `Keys.LeftArrow`
   and other code exposed in the `Keys` namespace instead.
 - For `sixtyfps::Timer` (C++ and Rust), it's now possible to call `restart()` after
   a timer has been stopped previously by calling `stop()`.
 - Property access in `.60` was optimized by doing more constant propagation.

### Added

 - Color names can now be accessed through the `Colors` namespace (in `.60`).
 - Math function are now available through the `Math` namespace (in `.60`).
 - `TouchArea` gained a `mouse-cursor` property to change the mouse cursor.
 - C++: Added `SIXTYFPS_VERSION_MAJOR`/`SIXTYFPS_VERSION_MINOR`/`SIXTYFPS_VERSION_PATCH` version macros.
 - More special keyboard key codes are provided in the `FocusScope`, and
   special keys are handled
 - `start()`, `stop()`, `running()` and a default constructor for C++ `sixtyfps::Timer`
 - Added math functions `log`, and `pow`.
 - Property animations now have a `delay` property, which will delay the start
   of the animation. Use this to create sequential animations.
 - Rust: Added `sixtyfps::VecModel::insert(&self, index, value)`.
 - C++: Added `sixtyfps::VecModel::insert(index, value)`.
 - Added ability to access elements of a model with the `[index]` syntax.

### Fixed

 - Memory leak in C++.
 - Native style: Colors are updated automatically when the Windowing system switches to and from dark mode (#687)
 - Ctrl/Command+X in text fields copies the selected text to the clipboard and deletes it (cut).
 - Improved native ComboBox look.
 - Fixed panics or compilation error when using two way bindings on global properties.

## [0.1.5] - 2021-11-24

### Changed

 - The sixtyfps compiler no longer "inline" all the elements, resulting in faster compilation
   time and smaller binaries.
 - Implemented basic constant propagation in the sixtyfps compiler

### Fixed

 - The Slider's changed callback was not being called with the fluent style (#621).
 - Fixed compilation error in C++'s `sixtyfps::blocking_invoke_from_main_loop` when the callable returns `void` (#623).

 - Fixed the maximization button in the window decoration when a window has a fixed size.

## [0.1.4] - 2021-10-22

### Changed

 - The TouchArea now grabs the mouse for every button instead of just the left button.
 - The ScrollView's default viewport size is no longer hardcoded to 1000px but depends on the contents.
 - In Rust, the `sixtyfps::Model` trait deprecates the `attach_peer` function in favor of `model_tracker`, where all
   you need to do is return a reference to your `sixtyfps::ModelNotify` field.

### Added

 - Enable support for compressed SVG (.svgz).
 - Viewer: added possibility to set shell callback handler with `--on <callback> <handler>`.
 - It is now possible to query the length of a model with `.length`.

### Fixed

 - Fixed the `PointerEvent.kind` always being down.
 - `LineEdit.has-hocus` with the native style

## [0.1.3] - 2021-10-06

### Changed

 - Due to changes in the build system, the C++ build now requires CMake >= 3.19.
 - Fluent style: The Slider and ScrollBar now updates as the mouse moves.
 - Parentheses around callable expression is now deprecated.
 - Naming a callback without calling it is now a hard error instead of producing error in the generated code.

### Added

## [0.1.2] - 2021-09-09

### Changed

 - Apply the default text color from the style for the `color` of `Text` and `TextInput` elements, to contrast
   correctly with the application of `Window`'s `background` property.
 - LineEdit scrolls to keep the cursor visible
 - The `clicked` callbacks are now only emitted if the release event is within the TouchArea's geometry
 - parentheses around the condition are no longer needed in `if` elements: `if condition : Foo { ... }`

### Added

 - One can now set an alias from the root to a global callback
 - It is now possible to access properties and callback of exported global objects from the native code (#96)
 - C++ API: `blocking_invoke_from_event_loop`: a blocking version of `invoke_from_event_loop`
 - TextInput can support multiple line by setting single-line to false

## [0.1.1] - 2021-08-19

### Changed
 - Fixed lookup scope when resolving model expression in `for` or `if` constructs:
   the `self` element now refers to the correct element instead of the root.
 - Rust: default to the native style if Qt is available
 - Rust: deprecated `SharedVector::as_slice_mut()`. Use `SharedVector::make_mut_slice()` instead.
 - The default non-native widget style is now the new "fluent" style.
 - The internal normalization of identifiers is using `-` instead of `_`, this is an internal
   change, but it can be seen in error messages. When listing properties the identifiers are
   preserved. For fields in structures they are normalized.
- Show a compilation error when there are duplicated element ids.
 - The `clip` property can now be any expression.

 - Properties of type `angle` and `duration` are allowed in the public API.
 - Every element now has a `visible` property.
 - `Slider` now has a `changed` callback.
 - Added `TabWidget` widget.
 - Rust: `sixtyfps::Image` can now be constructed from image data provided by `sixtyfps::SharedPixelBuffer`.
   This enables integrating with other low-level software rendering or the the popular Rust image crate.
 - VSCode extension: added an option to specify command line arguments for the LSP.

### Fixed

 - GridLayout cells with colspan and rowspan respect properly their constraints.
 - Don't panic when replacing programmatically text in a `TextInput` and then editing it.
 - The default height of elements in a ListView no longer defaults to 100%.
 - Fixed support for `*=` and `/=` on types with unit such as length.
 - Don't panic when using a self assignment operator on an invalid type - this produces a compiler error
   instead.
 - Fixed angle conversion for values specified in radians, gradians and turns.
 - Fixed SharedVector sometimes not allocating big enough storage.

## [0.1.0] - 2021-06-30

### Changed

 - Layouts are now conceptually their own elements, meaning that the `x` and `y` properties of items
   within layouts are relative to the layout and no longer to the parent element of layouts.
 - The default spacing and padding of layouts is now 0 instead of being specific to the style.
   There are now `HorizontalBox`, `VerticalBox`, `GridBox` widgets which have default spacing and padding.
 - Setting the window `height` and `width` properties results in a fixed size. The `preferred-width`
   and `preferred-height` property can be used to set the initial size and the window remains resizable

 - `sixtyfps::invoke_from_event_loop` was added to the C++ and Rust APIs, to run a function in the UI thread from any thread.
 - `sixtyfps::run_event_loop()` and `sixtyfps::quit_event_loop()` were added to the Rust and C++ APIs to start and quit the main event loop.
 - `z` property on items.

 - `sixtyfps::Image` is a new type in the public Rust and C++ API to load images from a path.
 - The width and height of images is now accessible via the `width`or `height` of an `image` type property in .60 files (`some-image.source.width`)

### Fixed

 - Fixed Mouse wheel to work on the `Flickable` element and derivatives.
 - Fixed generated C++ code on Windows.
 - Calling `debug(...)` no longer breaks the LSP.
 - `ComponentDefinition::properties` only exposes public properties as documented.
