## Coding Style

For the Rust portion of the code base, we enforce the coding style via rustfmt. The [`rustfmt.toml`](/rustfmt.toml) in the root direction is used to configure the style.

For the C++ portion of the code base, we enforce the coding style via `clang-format`, via the [`.clang-format`](/.clang-format) file in the root directory.

## Testing

All changes submitted to the repository are automatically built and tested via Github Actions and the corresponding workflow defined in the [`rust.yaml`](/.github/workflows/rust.yaml) file.

## Contributor License Agreement

When opening a pull request, you will be asked to sign a Contributor License Agreement (CLA) which
will allow us to relicense your contribution.
