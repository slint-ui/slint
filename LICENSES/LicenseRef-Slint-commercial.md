    deemed as made in breach of the Agreement ex tunc.

    3. Customer agrees to provide a written testimonial statement about the use of the Licensed Software.

14. If the license is granted for the purpose of evaluation (**Eval License**), then clauses 10 and 11 above

        Agreement infringes or will infringe such third parties
        intellectual property rights or other rights,

    5.  A Party shall promptly notify the other Party if it receives a
        claim that the other Party shall or may be obliged to indemnify.

        assistance needed for handling the claim. The Indemnifying Party
        may, at its cost and in its sole discretion, take control of the
        defense of such claim, including the conduct of any litigation
        or arbitration and the negotiation of any settlement, in which
        case the indemnifying Party shall not compromise or settle or
        otherwise dispose of the claim, in whole or in part, where such
        compromise or settlement or disposal would require any admission
        or stipulation which would reasonably be expected to have an
        adverse effect on the commercial reputation of the indemnified
        Party, without the prior written consent of the indemnified
        Party. Where the indemnifying Party has not taken control of the
        defense of the claim, the indemnified Party shall not compromise
        or settle or fail adequately to defend or otherwise dispose of a

    warranties of merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose.

    licensed software. The warranty disclaimer in the foregoing
    notwithstanding, Customer may have specific legal rights which may
    vary from state/jurisdiction to state/jurisdiction; as far as legally
    permissible, Customer waives any such legal rights vis-à-vis SixtyFPS.

19. SixtyFPS shall not under any circumstances be liable to Customer
    based on failure of the Licensed Software if the failure resulted
    from Customer's changing of the Licensed Software, from Customer's
    accident, abuse or misapplication, nor shall either party except
    in case of gross negligence or willful misconduct be liable for
    special damages, punitive or exemplary damages, damages for loss
    of profits or interruption of business or for loss or corruption
    of data, nor shall any award of damages from either party to the
    other party exceed the total amount Customer payable to SixtyFPS
    in connection with this agreement.

20. Each Party shall hold Confidential Information of the other Party,
    its customers, and licensors in confidence, and without written
    permission from will not disclose to any person or use for its own
    benefit, any such information. "Confidential Information" includes

    programs developed or licensed by the Parties, including all
    documentation and methods or concepts utilized therein, all
    adaptations and modifications thereto and derivative works thereof,
    and related materials and information. Confidential Information also

    received from a third Party not in breach of any obligation of
    confidentiality; (iii) independently developed by a Party without
    access to Confidential Information of the other Party; (iv) known to
    the other Party at the time of disclosure; (v) produced in
    compliance with applicable law or a court order, provided the other
    Party is given notice and opportunity to intervene; or (vi) it does
    not constitute a trade secret and more than five (5) years have
    elapsed from the date of disclosure. In addition to any other rights
    or remedies available, each Party shall be entitled to enforcement
    of such obligations by court injunction.

21. During the Term, an independent, certified auditor on SixtyFPS's
    behalf, may, upon its reasonable request, with 30 (thirty) days
    written notice, and at its SixtyFPS's sole expense, examine
    Customer's books and records solely with respect to Customer's use
    of the Licensed Software. Any such audit shall be conducted during
    regular business hours at Customer's facilities and shall not
    unreasonably interfere with Customer's business activities.
    SixtyFPS' auditor shall not remove, copy, or redistribute any
    electronic material during the course of an audit. Customer does not
    implicitly grant SixtyFPS or SixtyFPS' auditor any form of license
    agreement. If an audit reveals that Customer is using the Licensed
    Software in a way that is in material violation of the terms of the
    Agreement, then Customer shall pay SixtyFPS's reasonable costs of
    conducting the audit. In the case of a material violation, Customer
    agrees to pay SixtyFPS any amounts owing that are attributable to
    the unauthorized use. In the alternative, SixtyFPS reserves the
    right, at SixtyFPS's sole option, to terminate the licenses for the
    Licensed Software. SixtyFPS auditor shall before the audit sign
    Customer's standard NDA, and shall only be allowed to report
    violations of the terms of the Agreement to SixtyFPS, with a copy to
    the Customer. The Customer shall be provided the right to provide
    comments to the report before it is finalized.

22. If Customer materially breaches this Agreement, SixtyFPS will provide a 
    60 days written notice to the Customer during which any such breach(es) 
    may be cured, failing which SixtyFPS will terminate the agreement. 
    Customer undertakes to pay a contractual penalty for each case of 
    negligent breach of this Agreement of EUR 10.000, which shall not be 
    subject to a judicial right of reduction. SixtyFPS shall in any case be 
    free to assert any further damage/loss or other claims. The amount of 
    contractual penalty shall be offset against claims for damages, if any.

23. Customer may terminate this Agreement at any time for any reason
    upon 90 (ninety) days notice to SixtyFPS and upon payment of all
    applicable fees and contractual penalties, if any, in connection with
    the use of the Licensed Software.

24. In case of an Eval License, this Agreement will terminate at the end of
    the **Eval Period** as specified in the License Certificate.

25. Both Parties shall comply with all applicable laws and regulations
    relating to the Licensed Software in the countries in which the
    Parties use or modify the Licensed Software.

26. All notices and communications between the Parties shall be in
    writing and shall be deemed given when received. For avoidance of
    doubt, email is considered a written form of communication.

27. This Agreement shall be construed, interpreted and governed by the
    laws of the Federal Republic of Germany.

28. No term or condition contained in Customer's purchase order will
    apply unless expressly accepted by SixtyFPS in writing.

29. Customer may assign this Agreement, in whole or in part (whether by
    operation of law or otherwise), with prior consent of SixtyFPS, which 
    shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. SixtyFPS
    may assign this Agreement or any of its rights hereunder or
    delegate any of its obligations hereunder with prior notice to the Customer. 
    Any attempt to assign this Agreement other than in accordance with 
    this provision shall be null and void.

30. This Agreement constitutes the complete agreement between the
    Parties and supersedes all prior or contemporaneous discussions,
    representations, and proposals, written or oral, with respect to the
    subject matters discussed herein. No modification of this Agreement
    will be effective unless contained in a written document executed by an
    authorized representative of each Party. If any provision of the
    Agreement is found void or unenforceable, the remainder will remain
    valid and enforceable according to its terms. If any remedy provided
    is determined to have failed for its essential purpose, all
    limitations of liability and exclusions of damages set forth in this
    Agreement shall remain in effect.

    of the Licensed Software.

    Support will be provided for official stable release of the Licensed Software

    use to all users.

    reported to SixtyFPS. Customer is advised to recreate potential
    problems using the most recent release when reporting problems to

    the Customer's Products built with the Licensed Software. Customer understands 
    that workarounds may not be possible for all problems.

10. **Operating Systems Updates**

    SixtyFPS shall consider making commercially reasonable efforts to provide 
    Customers with updates to the Licensed Software for newly released versions 
    of operating systems. If, however, extensive changes to the Licensed Software
