    accident, abuse or misapplication, nor shall either party except
    in case of gross negligence or willful misconduct be liable for
    special damages, punitive or exemplary damages, damages for loss
    of profits or interruption of business or for loss or corruption
    of data, nor shall any award of damages from either party to the
    other party exceed the total amount Customer payable to SixtyFPS

    not constitute a trade secret and more than five (5) years have
    elapsed from the date of disclosure. In addition to any other rights
    or remedies available, each Party shall be entitled to enforcement
    of such obligations by court injunction.

    behalf, may, upon its reasonable request, with 30 (thirty) days
    written notice, and at its SixtyFPS's sole expense, examine
    Customer's books and records solely with respect to Customer's use
    of the Licensed Software. Any such audit shall be conducted during
    regular business hours at Customer's facilities and shall not
    unreasonably interfere with Customer's business activities.
    SixtyFPS' auditor shall not remove, copy, or redistribute any
    electronic material during the course of an audit. Customer does not
    implicitly grant SixtyFPS or SixtyFPS' auditor any form of license
    agreement. If an audit reveals that Customer is using the Licensed
    Software in a way that is in material violation of the terms of the
    Agreement, then Customer shall pay SixtyFPS's reasonable costs of
    conducting the audit. In the case of a material violation, Customer
    agrees to pay SixtyFPS any amounts owing that are attributable to
    the unauthorized use. In the alternative, SixtyFPS reserves the
    right, at SixtyFPS's sole option, to terminate the license for the
    Licensed Software. SixtyFPS auditor shall before the audit sign
    Customer's standard NDA, and shall only be allowed to report
    violations of the terms of the Agreement to SixtyFPS, with a copy to
    the Customer. The Customer shall be provided the right to provide
    comments to the report before it is finalized.

22. If Customer materially breaches this Agreement, SixtyFPS will provide a 
    60 days written notice to the Customer during which any such breach(es) 
    may be cured, failing which SixtyFPS will terminate the agreement. 
    Customer undertakes to pay a contractual penalty for each case of 
    negligent breach of this Agreement of EUR 10.000, which shall not be 
    subject to a judicial right of reduction. SixtyFPS shall in any case be 
    free to assert any further damage/loss or other claims. The amount of 
    contractual penalty shall be offset against claims for damages, if any.

23. Customer may terminate this Agreement at any time for any reason
    upon 90 (ninety) days notice to SixtyFPS and upon payment of all
    applicable fees and contractual penalties, if any, in connection with
    the use of the Licensed Software.

24. Both Parties shall comply with all applicable laws and regulations
    relating to the Licensed Software in the countries in which the
    Parties use or modify the Licensed Software.

25. All notices and communications between the Parties shall be in
    writing and shall be deemed given when received. For avoidance of
    doubt, email is considered a written form of communication.

26. This Agreement shall be construed, interpreted and governed by the
    laws of the Federal Republic of Germany.

27. No term or condition contained in Customer's purchase order will
    apply unless expressly accepted by SixtyFPS in writing.

28. Customer may assign this Agreement, in whole or in part (whether by
    operation of law or otherwise), with prior consent of SixtyFPS, which 
    shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. SixtyFPS
    may assign this Agreement or any of its rights hereunder or
    delegate any of its obligations hereunder with prior notice to the Customer. 
    Any attempt to assign this Agreement other than in accordance with 
    this provision shall be null and void.

29. This Agreement constitutes the complete agreement between the
    Parties and supersedes all prior or contemporaneous discussions,
    representations, and proposals, written or oral, with respect to the
    subject matters discussed herein. No modification of this Agreement
    will be effective unless contained in a written document executed by an
    authorized representative of each Party. If any provision of the
    Agreement is found void or unenforceable, the remainder will remain
    valid and enforceable according to its terms. If any remedy provided
    is determined to have failed for its essential purpose, all
    limitations of liability and exclusions of damages set forth in this
    Agreement shall remain in effect.
