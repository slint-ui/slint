    Licensed Software, including making modifications, for the sole purposes of
    designing, developing, and testing your Products during the Term. The number
    of **Users** using the Licensed Software to design, develop, and test your
    Products is limited to the amount of **User Seats** specified in the License

    modifications made to the Licensed Software, during the Term. Such
    distributions are permitted only with your Products and limited to the number
    of **Distributions** specified in the License Certificate.

    applicable **Fees**; if said Fees are not paid in full and by their due
    date, the license shall not be granted and your Products shall be deemed as
    made in breach of the Agreement ex tunc.

11. The Fees and any other charges under this Agreement shall be paid by
    you no later than thirty (30) days from the date of the applicable
    invoice from us. A late payment charge of five percent per month over and

    sale, delivery, or use of the Licensed Software pursuant to any applicable
    law.

13. The Parties also agree to all the following conditions:

    (a) You may not remove or alter any copyright, trademark, or other

    (b) Your Products may not compete with the Licensed Software,

    (c) You will indemnify and hold us, our affiliated companies, and our
        suppliers, harmless from and against any claims or liabilities
        arising out of the use, reproduction, or distribution of your
        Products, except as set out in clause 13.(d) immediately below,

    (d) We shall indemnify and hold you harmless from and against any
        claims from third parties alleging that the use of the Licensed Software
        as set out in this Agreement infringes or will infringe such third
        parties' intellectual property rights or other rights,

    (e) A Party shall promptly notify the other Party if it receives a claim that
        the other Party shall or may be obliged to indemnify. The Parties shall
        promptly give each other information and other assistance needed for
        handling the claim. The Indemnifying Party may, at its cost and in its
        sole discretion, take control of the defense of such claim, including
        the conduct of any litigation or arbitration and the negotiation of any
        settlement, in which case the indemnifying Party shall not compromise or
        settle or otherwise dispose of the claim, in whole or in part, where
        such compromise or settlement or disposal would require any admission or
        stipulation which would reasonably be expected to have an adverse effect
        on the commercial reputation of the indemnified Party, without the prior
        written consent of the indemnified Party. Where the indemnifying Party
        has not taken control of the defense of the claim, the indemnified Party
        shall not compromise or settle or fail adequately to defend or otherwise
        dispose of a claim, in whole or in part, without the written consent of
        the indemnifying Party, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or
        delayed.

    permitted by applicable law, we on behalf of us and our suppliers,
    disclaim all warranties and conditions, either express or implied,
    including, but not limited to, any implied warranties of merchantability or
    fitness for a particular purpose, title, and non-infringement with regard to
    the Licensed Software. The warranty disclaimer in the foregoing
    notwithstanding, you may have specific legal rights which may vary from
    state/jurisdiction to state/jurisdiction; as far as legally permissible, you
    waive any such legal rights vis-à-vis us.

15. We shall not under any circumstances be liable to you based on failure of

    Licensed Software, from your accident, abuse or misapplication, nor shall
    we except in case of gross negligence or willful misconduct be
    liable for special damages, punitive or exemplary damages, damages for loss
    of profits or interruption of business or for loss or corruption of data,
    nor shall any award of damages exceed the total amount you paid to us in
    connection with this Agreement.

    therein, all adaptations and modifications thereto and derivative works
    thereof, and related materials and information. Confidential Information
    also includes any other information identified by either Party, its
    licensors, or customers as proprietary or confidential, or which would

        Information of the other Party;

    4. known to the other Party at the time of disclosure;

    5. produced in compliance with applicable law or a court order, provided the
        other Party is given notice and opportunity to intervene; or

    6. it does not constitute a trade secret and more than five (5) years have
        elapsed from the date of disclosure. In addition to any other rights or
        remedies available, each Party shall be entitled to enforcement of such
        obligations by court injunction.

    its reasonable request, with 30 (thirty) days written notice, and at its
    sole expense, examine your books and records solely with respect to your use
    of the Licensed Software. Any such audit shall be conducted during regular
    business hours at your facilities and shall not unreasonably interfere with
    your business activities. Our auditor shall not remove, copy, or
    redistribute any electronic material during an audit. If an audit reveals that
    you are using the Licensed Software in a way that is in material violation
    of the terms of this Agreement, then you shall pay us reasonable costs of
    conducting the audit. Our auditor shall only be allowed to report violations
    of the terms of this Agreement, with a copy to you. You shall be provided

    to the Licensed Software in the countries in which the Parties use or modify

    law or otherwise), with prior consent from us, which shall not be
    unreasonably withheld or delayed. We may assign this Agreement or any of its
    rights hereunder or delegate any of its obligations hereunder with prior
    notice to you. Any attempt to assign this Agreement other than in accordance
    with this provision shall be null and void.

25. This Agreement constitutes the complete agreement between the Parties and
    supersedes all prior or contemporaneous discussions, representations, and
    proposals, written or oral, with respect to the subject matters discussed
    herein. No modification of this Agreement will be effective unless contained
    in a written document executed by an authorized representative of each
    Party. If any provision of the Agreement is found void or unenforceable, the
    remainder will remain valid and enforceable according to its terms. If any
    remedy provided is determined to have failed for its essential purpose, all
    limitations of liability and exclusions of damages set forth in this
    Agreement shall remain in effect.
