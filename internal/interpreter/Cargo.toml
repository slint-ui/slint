[features]

default = ["std", "backend-winit", "renderer-winit-femtovg", "backend-qt", "accessibility", "compat-1-0"]

## Mandatory feature:
## This feature is required to keep the compatibility with Slint 1.0
## Newer patch version may put current functionality behind a new feature
## that would be enabled by default only if this feature was added
"compat-1-0" = []

## enable the [`print_diagnostics`] function to show diagnostic in the console output
display-diagnostics = ["i-slint-compiler/display-diagnostics"]

# (internal) export C++ FFI functions
ffi = ["spin_on", "i-slint-core/ffi"]

# (internal) Draw an highlight on a specified element
# NOTE: this is not a semver compatible feature
highlight = []

## Enable use of the Rust standard library.
std = ["i-slint-core/std"]

#! ### Backends

#! See the documentation of the [`slint` crate](https://docs.rs/slint/latest/slint/#backends)

## The Qt backend feature uses Qt for the windowing system integration and rendering.
## This backend also provides the `native` style.
## It requires Qt 5.15 or later to be installed. If Qt is not installed, the
## backend will not be operational
backend-qt = ["i-slint-backend-selector/i-slint-backend-qt", "std"]

## The [winit](https://crates.io/crates/log) crate is used for the event loop and windowing system integration.
## With this feature, both x11 and wayland windowing systems are supported. For a smaller build, omit
## this feature and select one of the other specific `backend-winit-XX` features.
backend-winit = ["i-slint-backend-selector/backend-winit", "std"]

## Simliar to `backend-winit` this enables the winit based event loop but only
## with support for the X Window System on Unix.
backend-winit-x11 = ["i-slint-backend-selector/backend-winit-x11", "std"]

## Simliar to `backend-winit` this enables the winit based event loop but only
## with support for the Wayland window system on Unix.
backend-winit-wayland = ["i-slint-backend-selector/backend-winit-wayland", "std"]

## Make the winit backend capable of rendering using the [femtovg](https://crates.io/crates/femtovg) crate.
## Must be used in combination with `backend-winit`, `backend-winit-x11`, or `backend-winit-wayland`.
renderer-winit-femtovg = ["i-slint-backend-selector/renderer-winit-femtovg", "std"]

## Make the winit backend capable of rendering using [Skia](https://skia.org/).
## Must be used in combination with `backend-winit`, `backend-winit-x11`, or `backend-winit-wayland`.
renderer-winit-skia = ["i-slint-backend-selector/renderer-winit-skia", "std"]

## Same as `renderer-winit-skia`, but Skia will always use OpenGL.
renderer-winit-skia-opengl = ["i-slint-backend-selector/renderer-winit-skia-opengl", "std"]

## Same as `renderer-winit-skia`, but Skia will always use Vulkan.
renderer-winit-skia-vulkan = ["i-slint-backend-selector/renderer-winit-skia-vulkan", "std"]

## Make the winit backend capable of rendering using the software renderer.
## Must be used in combination with `backend-winit`, `backend-winit-x11`, or `backend-winit-wayland`.
renderer-winit-software = ["i-slint-backend-selector/renderer-winit-software"]

## Enable integration with operating system provided accessibility APIs (default: enabled)
##
## Enabling this feature will try to expose the tree of UI elements to OS provided accessibility
## APIs to support screen readers and other assistive technologies.
accessibility = ["i-slint-backend-selector/accessibility"]
