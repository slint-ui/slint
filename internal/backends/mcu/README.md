**NOTE**: This library is an **internal** crate of the [Slint project](https://slint-ui.com).
This crate should **not be used directly** by applications using Slint.
You should use the `slint` crate instead.

**WARNING**: This crate does not follow the semver convention for versioning and can
only be used with `version = "=x.y.z"` in Cargo.toml.

# Slint MCU backend

The MCU backend is still a work in progress.

We are currently working on getting demo running with the [Raspberry Pi Pico](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-pico/)
and [ST7789 based screen](https://www.waveshare.com/pico-restouch-lcd-2.8.htm).
The Raspberry Pi Pico uses a RP2040 micro-controller which has 264KB of RAM and 2MB of flash memory.

The other backend is the simulator which is a way to test the software rendering backend on desktop.

## How to use

In order to use this backend, the final program must depend on both `slint` and `i_slint_backend_mcu`.
The main.rs will look something like this

```rust,ignore
#![no_std]
#![cfg_attr(not(feature = "simulator"), no_main)]
slint::include_modules!();

#[i_slint_backend_mcu::entry]
fn main() -> ! {
    i_slint_backend_mcu::init();
    MainWindow::new().run();
    panic!("The event loop should not return");
}
```

Since i_slint_backend_mcu is at the moment an internal crate not uploaded to crates.io, you must
use the git version of slint, slint-build, and i_slint_backend_mcu

```toml
[dependencies]
slint = { git = "https://github.com/slint-ui/slint" }
i_slint_backend_mcu = { git = "https://github.com/slint-ui/slint" }
# ...
[build-dependencies]
slint-build = { git = "https://github.com/slint-ui/slint" }
```

## Run the demo:

We must tell the compiler what font sizes to embed in the final binary with the SLINT_FONT_SIZES environment variable.

```sh
export SLINT_FONT_SIZES=8,11,10,12,13,14,15,16,18,20,22,24,32
```

### The simulator


```sh
cargo run -p printerdemo_mcu --features=i-slint-backend-mcu/simulator --release
```

### On the Raspberry Pi Pico

You need nightly rust because that's the only way to get an allocator.

Build the demo with:

```sh
cargo +nightly build -p printerdemo_mcu --features=mcu-pico-st7789 --target=thumbv6m-none-eabi --release
```

You should process the file with  [elf2uf2-rs](https://github.com/jonil/elf2uf2-rs)

```sh
cargo install elf2uf2-rs
elf2uf2-rs target/thumbv6m-none-eabi/release/printerdemo_mcu
```

Then upload the demo to the raspberry pi: push the "bootsel" white button on the device while connecting the
micro-usb cable to the device, this connect some storage where you can store the binary.

Or from the command on linux: (connect the device while pressing the "bootsel" button.

```
# mount the device
udisksctl mount -b /dev/sda1
# upload
elf2uf2-rs -d target/thumbv6m-none-eabi/release/printerdemo_mcu
```

#### Using probe-run

This require [probe-run](https://github.com/knurling-rs/probe-run) (`cargo install probe-run`)
and to connect the pico via a probe (for example another pico running the probe)

Then you can simply run with `cargo run`

```sh
CARGO_TARGET_THUMBV6M_NONE_EABI_LINKER="flip-link" CARGO_TARGET_THUMBV6M_NONE_EABI_RUNNER="probe-run --chip RP2040" cargo +nightly run -p printerdemo_mcu --features=mcu-pico-st7789 --target=thumbv6m-none-eabi --release
```
