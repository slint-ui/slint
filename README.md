Slint is a toolkit to efficiently design, develop and deploy responsive apps on any screen. Frontends built with Slint can be easily integrated with backends written in different programming languages such as C/C++, Rust, and JavaScript. Slint is developed by SixtyFPS GmbH together with the community. We invite you to use Slint and be part of its community.

## Get Started

Check the [online demos](#demos-running-in-webassembly-simulation) or
[build on your own system](docs/building.md). Also check out the [documentation](#documentation).

## Current Status

Slint is in active development. The state of the toolkit for each platform is as follows:

 - **Embedded**: *Ready!* Slint is already being used in production projects by customers 
   (running on an Arm processor with Linux).
 - **Microcontrollers** (MCU): *Ready*. Slint apps can run on MCUs with less than 300K of RAM.
   [Video of Slint on STM32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNNOJJsOAis) â€“
   [Video of Slint on RP2040](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dkBwNocItGs) â€“ 
   [docs](https://slint-ui.com/docs/rust/slint/docs/mcu/index.html)
 - **Desktop**: *In Progress*. While Slint is usable on Windows, Linux and Mac, we are working on 
   improving the platform support in subsequent releases.
 - **Mobile** (Android/iOS): *Todo*. We haven't started supporting mobile platforms yet, but it
   is our intention to do so in the near future.
 - **Web**: *In Progress*. Slint apps can be compiled to WebAssembly and can run in a web browser.
   As there are many other web frameworks, the web platform is not one of our primary target platforms.
   The web support is currently limited to demo purposes.

### Accessibility

 Slint supports keyboard based navigation of many widgets, and user interfaces are scalable. 
 The basic infrastructure for assistive technology like screen readers is in place, but currently requires 
 the Qt backend.
 We are aware that more work is needed to get best-of-class support for users with special needs.

## The .slint Markup Language

Slint comes with a markup language that is specifically designed for user interfaces. This language provides a
powerful way to describe graphical elements, their placement, and the flow of data through the different states. It is a familiar syntax to describe the hierarchy of elements and property bindings. Here's the obligatory "Hello World":

```slint
HelloWorld := Window {
    width: 400px;
    height: 400px;

    Text {
       y: parent.width / 2;
       x: parent.x + 200px;
       text: "Hello, world";
       color: blue;
    }
}
```

Check out the [language reference](docs/langref.md) for more details.

## Architecture

An application is composed of the business logic written in Rust, C++, or JavaScript and the `.slint` user interface design markup, which
is compiled to native code.

![Architecture Overview](https://slint-ui.com/resources/architecture.drawio.svg)

### Compiler

The `.slint` files are compiled ahead of time. The expressions in the `.slint` are pure functions that the
compiler can optimize. For example, the compiler could choose to "inline" properties and remove those
that are constant or unchanged. In the future we hope to improve rendering time on low end devices by
pre-processing images and text. The compiler could determine that a `Text` or an `Image` element is
always on top of another `Image` in the same location. Consequently both elements could be rendered ahead
of time into a single element, thus cutting down on rendering time.

The compiler uses the typical compiler phases of lexing, parsing, optimization, and finally code
generation. It provides different back-ends for code generation in the target language. The C++ code
generator produces a C++ header file, the Rust generator produces Rust code, and so on. An interpreter
for dynamic languages is also included.

### Runtime

The runtime library consists of an engine that supports properties declared in the `.slint` language.
Components with their elements, items, and properties are laid out in a single memory region, to reduce
memory allocations.

Rendering backends and styles are configurable at compile time. Current there are two back-ends:

 * The `gl` backend uses OpenGL ES 2.0 for rendering.
 * The `qt` backend uses Qt's QStyle to achieve native looking widgets. In the future it could also use
   QPainter.

### Tooling

We have a few tools to help with the development of .slint files:
 - A [**LSP Server**](./tools/lsp) that adds features like auto-complete and live preview of the .slint files to many editors.
 - It is bundled in a [**Visual Studio Code Extension**](./editors/vscode) available from the market place.
 - A [**slint-viewer**](./tools/viewer) tool which displays the .slint files. The `--auto-reload` argument makes it easy to preview
   your UI while you are working on it (when using the LSP preview is not possible).
 - An [**online editor**](https://slint-ui.com/editor) to try out .slint syntax without installing anything ([sources](./tools/online_editor)).
 - An [**updater**](./tools/syntax_updater) to convert the .slint files from previous versions to newer versions.
 - An experimental [**Figma importer**](./tools/figma_import).

Please check our [Editors README](./editors/README.md) for tips on how to configure your favorite editor to work well with Slint.
