#![doc = concat!("If you are new to Slint, start with the [Walk-through **tutorial**](https://slint.dev/releases/", env!("CARGO_PKG_VERSION"), "/docs/slint/src/quickstart)")]
/*! If you are already familiar with Slint, the following topics provide related information.

## Topics

*/
#![doc = concat!("- [The Slint Language Documentation](https://slint.dev/releases/", env!("CARGO_PKG_VERSION"), "/docs/slint)")]
/*! - [Type mappings between .slint and Rust](docs::type_mappings)
 - [Feature flags and backend selection](docs::cargo_features)
 - [Slint on Microcontrollers](docs::mcu)

## How to use this crate:

Designs of user interfaces are described in the `.slint` design markup language. There are three ways
of including them in Rust:

 - The `.slint` code is [inline in a macro](#the-slint-code-in-a-macro).
 - The `.slint` code in [external files compiled with `build.rs`](#the-slint-code-in-external-files-is-compiled-with-buildrs)
*/
#![doc = concat!(" - The `.slint` code is loaded dynamically at run-time from the file system, by using the [interpreter API](https://slint.dev/releases/", env!("CARGO_PKG_VERSION"), "/docs/rust/slint_interpreter/).")]
/*!

With the first two methods, the markup code is translated to Rust code and each component is turned into a Rust
struct with functions. Use these functions to instantiate and show the component, and
to access declared properties. Check out our [sample component](docs::generated_code::SampleComponent) for more
information about the generation functions and how to use them.

### The .slint code in a macro

This method combines your Rust code with the `.slint` design markup in one file, using a macro:

```rust
slint::slint!{
    export component HelloWorld {
        Text {
            text: "hello world";
            color: green;
        }
    }
}
fn main() {
#   return; // Don't run a window in an example
    HelloWorld::new().unwrap().run().unwrap();
}
```

### The .slint code in external files is compiled with `build.rs`

When your design becomes bigger in terms of markup code, you may want move it to a dedicated*/
#![doc = concat!("`.slint` file. It's also possible to split a `.slint` file into multiple files using [modules](https://slint.dev/releases/", env!("CARGO_PKG_VERSION"), "/docs/slint/src/language/syntax/modules.html).")]
/*!Use a [build script](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/build-scripts.html) to compile
your main `.slint` file:

In your Cargo.toml add a `build` assignment and use the `slint-build` crate in `build-dependencies`:

```toml
[package]
...
build = "build.rs"
edition = "2021"

[dependencies]
slint = "1.8.0"
...

[build-dependencies]
slint-build = "1.8.0"
```

Use the API of the slint-build crate in the `build.rs` file:

```rust,no_run
fn main() {
    slint_build::compile("ui/hello.slint").unwrap();
}
```

Finally, use the [`include_modules!`] macro in your `main.rs`:

```ignore
slint::include_modules!();
fn main() {
    HelloWorld::new().unwrap().run().unwrap();
}
```

Use our [Template Repository](https://github.com/slint-ui/slint-rust-template) to create a skeleton file
hierarchy that uses this method:

1. Download and extract the [ZIP archive of the Rust Template](https://github.com/slint-ui/slint-rust-template/archive/refs/heads/main.zip).
2. Rename the extracted directory and change into it:

```bash
mv slint-rust-template-main my-project
cd my-project
```

## Generated components

Exported component from the macro or the main file that inherit `Window` or `Dialog` is mapped to a Rust structure.

The components are generated and re-exported to the location of the [`include_modules!`] or [`slint!`] macro.
It is represented as a struct with the same name as the component.

For example, if you have

```slint,no-preview
export component MyComponent inherits Window { /*...*/ }
```

in the .slint file, it will create a
```rust
struct MyComponent{ /*...*/ }
```

See also our [sample component](docs::generated_code::SampleComponent) for more information about the API of the generated struct.

A component is instantiated using the [`fn new() -> Self`](docs::generated_code::SampleComponent::new) function. The following
convenience functions are available through the [`ComponentHandle`] implementation:

  - [`fn clone_strong(&self) -> Self`](docs::generated_code::SampleComponent::clone_strong): creates a strongly referenced clone of the component instance.
  - [`fn as_weak(&self) -> Weak`](docs::generated_code::SampleComponent::as_weak): to create a [weak](Weak) reference to the component instance.
  - [`fn show(&self)`](docs::generated_code::SampleComponent::show): to show the window of the component.
  - [`fn hide(&self)`](docs::generated_code::SampleComponent::hide): to hide the window of the component.
  - [`fn run(&self)`](docs::generated_code::SampleComponent::run): a convenience function that first calls `show()`,
    followed by spinning the event loop, and `hide()` when returning from the event loop.
  - [`fn global<T: Global<Self>>(&self) -> T`](docs::generated_code::SampleComponent::global): an accessor to the global singletons,

For each top-level property
  - A setter [`fn set_<property_name>(&self, value: <PropertyType>)`](docs::generated_code::SampleComponent::set_counter)
  - A getter [`fn get_<property_name>(&self) -> <PropertyType>`](docs::generated_code::SampleComponent::get_counter)

For each top-level callback
  - [`fn invoke_<callback_name>(&self)`](docs::generated_code::SampleComponent::invoke_hello): to invoke the callback
  - [`fn on_<callback_name>(&self, callback: impl Fn(<CallbackArgs>) + 'static)`](docs::generated_code::SampleComponent::on_hello): to set the callback handler.

Note: All dashes (`-`) are replaced by underscores (`_`) in names of types or functions.

After instantiating the component, call [`ComponentHandle::run()`] on show it on the screen and spin the event loop to
react to input events. To show multiple components simultaneously, call [`ComponentHandle::show()`] on each instance.
Call [`run_event_loop()`] when you're ready to enter the event loop.

The generated component struct acts as a handle holding a strong reference (similar to an `Rc`). The `Clone` trait is
not implemented. Instead you need to make explicit [`ComponentHandle::clone_strong`] and [`ComponentHandle::as_weak`]
calls. A strong reference should not be captured by the closures given to a callback, as this would produce a reference
loop and leak the component. Instead, the callback function should capture a weak component.

## Threading and Event-loop

For platform-specific reasons, the event loop must run in the main thread, in most backends, and all the components
must be created in the same thread as the thread the event loop is running or is going to run.

You should perform the minimum amount of work in the main thread and delegate the actual logic to another
thread to avoid blocking animations. Use the [`invoke_from_event_loop`] function to communicate from your worker thread to the UI thread.

To run a function with a delay or with an interval use a [`Timer`].

To run an async function or a future, use [`spawn_local()`].

## Exported Global singletons

*/
#![doc = concat!("When you export a [global singleton](https://slint.dev/releases/", env!("CARGO_PKG_VERSION"), "/docs/slint/src/language/syntax/globals.html) from the main file,")]
/*! it is also generated with the exported name. Like the main component, the generated struct have
inherent method to access the properties and callback:

For each property
  - A setter: `fn set_<property_name>(&self, value: <PropertyType>)`
  - A getter: `fn get_<property_name>(&self) -> <PropertyType>`

For each callback
  - `fn invoke_<callback_name>(&self, <CallbackArgs>) -> <ReturnValue>` to invoke the callback
  - `fn on_<callback_name>(&self, callback: impl Fn(<CallbackArgs>) + 'static)` to set the callback handler.

The global can be accessed with the [`ComponentHandle::global()`] function, or with [`Global::get()`]

See the [documentation of the `Global` trait](Global) for an example.

**Note**: Global singletons are instantiated once per component. When declaring multiple components for `export` to Rust,
each instance will have their own instance of associated globals singletons.

/// # Compatibility with Tokio and other runtimes

/// may not work. This may be an issue if you call `.await` on a future created by another
/// runtime, or pass the future directly to `spawn_local`.
///
/// Futures from the [smol](https://docs.rs/smol/latest/smol/) runtime always hand off their work to
/// separate I/O threads that run in parallel to the Slint event loop.
///
/// The [Tokio](https://docs.rs/tokio/latest/tokio/index.html) runtime is to the following constraints:
///
/// * Tokio futures require entering the context of a global Tokio runtime.
/// * Tokio futures aren't guaranteed to hand off their work to separate threads and may therefore not complete, because
/// the Slint runtime can't drive the Tokio runtime.
/// * Tokio futures require regular yielding to the Tokio runtime for fairness, a constraint that also can't be met by Slint.
/// * Tokio's [current-thread schedule](https://docs.rs/tokio/latest/tokio/runtime/index.html#current-thread-scheduler)
/// cannot be used in Slint main thread, because Slint cannot yield to it.
///
/// To address these constraints, use [async_compat](https://docs.rs/async-compat/latest/async_compat/index.html)'s [Compat::new()](https://docs.rs/async-compat/latest/async_compat/struct.Compat.html#method.new)
/// to implicitly allocate a shared, multi-threaded Tokio runtime that will be used for Tokio futures.
///
/// The following little example demonstrates the use of Tokio's [`TcpStream`](https://docs.rs/tokio/latest/tokio/net/struct.TcpStream.html) to
/// read from a network socket. The entire future passed to `spawn_local()` is wrapped in `Compat::new()` to make it run:
///
/// ```rust,no_run
/// // A dummy TCP server that once reports "Hello World"
/// # i_slint_backend_testing::init_integration_test_with_mock_time();
/// use std::io::Write;

/// let server = std::thread::spawn(move || {

///     stream.write("Hello World".as_bytes()).unwrap();
/// });
///
/// let slint_future = async move {
///     use tokio::io::AsyncReadExt;
///     let mut stream = tokio::net::TcpStream::connect(local_addr).await.unwrap();
///     let mut data = Vec::new();
///     stream.read_to_end(&mut data).await.unwrap();
///     assert_eq!(data, "Hello World".as_bytes());
