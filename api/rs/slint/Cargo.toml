## Mandatory feature:
## This feature is required to keep the compatibility with Slint 0.2.0
## Newer patch version may put current functionality behind a new feature
## that would be enabled by default only if this feature was added
compat-0-2-0 = []

## Enable use of the Rust standard library.
std = ["i-slint-core/std"]

#! ### Backends

## The Qt backend feature uses Qt for the windowing system integration and rendering.
## This backend is required to use the `native` style.
## It requires Qt 5.15 or later to be installed. If Qt is not installed, the
## backend will not be operational
backend-qt = ["i-slint-backend-selector/i-slint-backend-qt", "std"]

# The following backend-gl-* are just alias for compatibility
backend-gl-all = ["eventloop-winit", "renderer-femtovg"]
backend-gl-x11 = ["eventloop-winit-x11", "renderer-femtovg"]
backend-gl-wayland = ["eventloop-winit-wayland", "renderer-femtovg"]

## The the `winit` crate is used for the event loop and windowing system integration.
## With this feature, all windowing systems are supported. For a smaller build, omit
## this feature and select one of the other specific `eventloop-winit-XX` features.
eventloop-winit = ["i-slint-backend-selector/eventloop-winit", "std"]

## Simliar to `eventloop-winit` this enables the winit based event loop but only
## with support for the X Window System on Unix.
eventloop-winit-x11 = ["i-slint-backend-selector/eventloop-winit-x11", "std"]

## Simliar to `eventloop-winit` this enables the winit based event loop but only
## with support for the Wayland window system on Unix.
eventloop-winit-wayland = ["i-slint-backend-selector/eventloop-winit-wayland", "std"]

## This feature is an alias for `backend-qt`
eventloop-qt = ["backend-qt"]

## The `femtovg` crate is available for rendering. 
renderer-femtovg = ["i-slint-backend-selector/renderer-femtovg", "std"]

## The Skia based rendering engine.
renderer-skia = ["i-slint-backend-selector/renderer-skia", "std"]

## The software rendering engine
renderer-software = ["i-slint-backend-selector/renderer-software"]

## This feature is an alias for `backend-qt`
