## Mandatory feature:
## This feature is required to keep the compatibility with Slint 1.2
## Newer patch version may put current functionality behind a new feature
## that would be enabled by default only if this feature was added.
## [More info in this blog post](https://slint.dev/blog/rust-adding-default-cargo-feature.html)
"compat-1-2" = []
"compat-1-0" = ["compat-1-2", "renderer-software"]

## Enable use of the Rust standard library.
std = ["i-slint-core/std"]

## Enable the translations using [gettext](https://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/gettext)
##
## the `@tr(...)` code from .slint files will be transformed into call to `dgettext`
## with the crate name as domain name
##
## translations must be enabled with the [`init_translations!`] macro
gettext = ["i-slint-core/gettext-rs"]

## This feature enables floating point arithmetic emulation using the [libm](https://crates.io/crates/libm) crate. Use this
## in MCU environments where the processor does not support floating point arithmetic.
libm = ["i-slint-core/libm"]

## If enabled, calls of `debug()` in `.slint` files use to the [`log::debug!()`] macro
## of the [log](https://crates.io/crates/log) crate instead of just `println!()`.
log = ["dep:log"]

## Implement the `serde::Serialize` and `serde::Deserialize` for some of the base types
## such as `SharedString` and `SharedVector`.
serde = ["i-slint-core/serde"]

## This feature enables the software renderer to pick up fonts from the operating system for text rendering.
software-renderer-systemfonts = ["renderer-software", "i-slint-core/software-renderer-systemfonts"]

## Slint uses internally some `thread_local` state.
##
## When the `std` feature is enabled, Slint can use [`std::thread_local!`], but when in a `#![no_std]`
## environment, we need a replacement. Using this feature, Slint will just use static variable
## disregarding Rust's Send and Sync safety
##
## **Safety** : You must ensure that there is only one single thread that call into the Slint API
unsafe-single-threaded = ["i-slint-core/unsafe-single-threaded"]

## Enable integration with operating system provided accessibility APIs
##
## Enabling this feature will try to expose the tree of UI elements to OS provided accessibility
## APIs to support screen readers and other assistive technologies.
accessibility = ["i-slint-backend-selector/accessibility"]

## Enable integration with [raw-window-handle](raw_window_handle_06) version 0.6. This provides a
## [`Window::window_handle()`] function that returns a struct that implements
## [HasWindowHandle](raw_window_handle_06::HasWindowHandle) and
## [HasDisplayHandle](raw_window_handle_06::HasDisplayHandle) implementation.
raw-window-handle-06 = ["dep:raw-window-handle-06", "i-slint-backend-selector/raw-window-handle-06"]

## Enable the default image formats from the `image` crate, to support additional image formats in [`Image::load_from_path`]
## and `@image-url`. When this feature is disabled, only PNG and JPEG are supported. When enabled,
## the following image formats are supported:
## AVIF, BMP, DDS, Farbfeld, GIF, HDR, ICO, JPEG, EXR, PNG, PNM, QOI, TGA, TIFF, WebP.
image-default-formats = ["i-slint-core/image-default-formats"]

## Enable the live reload feature
##
## Enable this feature to reload the .slint files at runtime and reload it whenever the files are modified on disk.
## For this feature to work, it's also required to set the `SLINT_LIVE_RELOAD` environment variable during
## application compilation.
##
## This is a feature for debugging and development. It's not recommended to add this feature to your Cargo.toml.
## Instead, use the `--features` command line argument like so when building your app:
## ```bash
## SLINT_LIVE_RELOAD=1 cargo build --features slint/live-reload
## ```
live-reload = ["dep:slint-interpreter"]

#! ### Backends

#! Slint needs a backend that will act as liaison between Slint and the OS.
#! By default, Slint will use the Qt backend, if Qt is installed, otherwise, it
#! will use [Winit](https://crates.io/crates/winit) with [FemtoVG](https://crates.io/crates/femtovg).
#! Both backends are compiled in. If you want to not compile one of these you need
#! to disable the default feature and re-enable one backend. It is also possible
#! to use Slint without backend if you provide the platform abstraction yourself
#! with [`platform::set_platform()`].
#!
#! If you enable the Winit backend, you need to also include a renderer.
#! `renderer-femtovg` is the only stable renderer, the other ones are experimental
#!
#! It is also possible to select the backend and renderer at runtime when several
#! are enabled, using the `SLINT_BACKEND`  environment variable.
#!  * `SLINT_BACKEND=Qt` selects the Qt backend
#!  * `SLINT_BACKEND=winit` selects the winit backend
#!  * `SLINT_BACKEND=winit-femtovg` selects the winit backend with the FemtoVG renderer
#!  * `SLINT_BACKEND=winit-skia` selects the winit backend with the skia renderer
#!  * `SLINT_BACKEND=winit-software` selects the winit backend with the software renderer
#!
#! If the selected backend is not available, the default will be used.
#!
#! Here are the cargo features controlling the backend:

## The Qt backend feature uses Qt for the windowing system integration and rendering.
## This backend also provides the `native` style.
## It requires Qt 5.15 or later to be installed. If Qt is not installed, the
## backend will not be operational
backend-qt = ["i-slint-backend-selector/backend-qt", "std", "i-slint-backend-qt"]

## The [winit](https://crates.io/crates/winit) crate is used for the event loop and windowing system integration.
## It supports Windows, macOS, web browsers, X11 and Wayland. X11 and wayland are only available when
## compiling for Linux or other Unix-like operating systems. With this feature, both X11 and Wayland are supported.
## For a smaller build, omit this feature and select one of the other specific `backend-winit-XX` features.
backend-winit = ["i-slint-backend-selector/backend-winit", "std"]

## Simliar to `backend-winit` this enables the winit based event loop but only
## with support for the X Window System on Unix.
backend-winit-x11 = ["i-slint-backend-selector/backend-winit-x11", "std"]

## Simliar to `backend-winit` this enables the winit based event loop but only
## with support for the Wayland window system on Unix.
backend-winit-wayland = ["i-slint-backend-selector/backend-winit-wayland", "std"]

## Alias to a backend and renderer that depends on the platform.
## Will select the Qt backend on linux if present, and the winit otherwise
backend-default = ["i-slint-backend-selector/default", "i-slint-backend-qt"]

# deprecated aliases
renderer-winit-femtovg = ["renderer-femtovg"]
renderer-winit-skia = ["renderer-skia"]
renderer-winit-skia-opengl = ["renderer-skia-opengl"]
renderer-winit-skia-vulkan = ["renderer-skia-vulkan"]
renderer-winit-software = ["renderer-software"]

## Render using the [FemtoVG](https://crates.io/crates/femtovg) crate.
renderer-femtovg = ["i-slint-backend-selector/renderer-femtovg", "dep:i-slint-renderer-femtovg", "std"]
## Render using the [FemtoVG](https://crates.io/crates/femtovg) crate and [WGPU](https://crates.io/crates/wgpu).
renderer-femtovg-wgpu = ["i-slint-backend-selector/renderer-femtovg-wgpu", "dep:i-slint-renderer-femtovg", "std"]

## Render using [Skia](https://skia.org/).
renderer-skia = ["i-slint-backend-selector/renderer-skia", "std"]

## Same as `renderer-skia`, but Skia will always use OpenGL.
renderer-skia-opengl = ["i-slint-backend-selector/renderer-skia-opengl", "std"]

## Same as `renderer-skia`, but Skia will always use Vulkan.
renderer-skia-vulkan = ["i-slint-backend-selector/renderer-skia-vulkan", "std"]

## Render using the software renderer.
renderer-software = ["i-slint-backend-selector/renderer-software", "i-slint-core/software-renderer"]

## KMS with Vulkan or EGL and libinput on Linux are used to render the application in full screen mode, without any
## windowing system. Requires libseat. If you don't have libseat, select `backend-linuxkms-noseat` instead. (Experimental)
backend-linuxkms = ["i-slint-backend-selector/backend-linuxkms", "std"]

## KMS with Vulkan or EGL and libinput on Linux are used to render the application in full screen mode, without any
## windowing system. (Experimental)
backend-linuxkms-noseat = ["i-slint-backend-selector/backend-linuxkms-noseat", "std"]

## Use the backend based on the [android-activity](https://docs.rs/android-activity) crate. (Using it's native activity feature)
backend-android-activity-06 = [
  "i-slint-backend-android-activity/native-activity",
  "i-slint-backend-android-activity/aa-06",
]

## **Deprecated** Use previous version of android-activity. This is mutually exclusive with `backend-android-activity-06`.
backend-android-activity-05 = [
  "i-slint-backend-android-activity/native-activity",
  "i-slint-backend-android-activity/aa-05",
]

## Enable support for [WGPU](http://wgpu.rs) based rendering and expose WGPU based APIs based on WGPU version 25.x.
##
## APIs guarded with this feature are *NOT* subject to the usual Slint API stability guarantees, because WGPU releases new major
## versions frequently. This feature as well as the APIs changed or removed in future minor releases of Slint, likely to be replaced
## by a feature with a similar name but the WGPU version suffix being bumped.
##
## To avoid unintended compilation failures, we recommend to use the [tilde requirement](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/specifying-dependencies.html#tilde-requirements)
## in your `Cargo.toml` when enabling this feature:
##
## ```toml
## slint = { version = "~1.13", features = ["unstable-wgpu-26"] }
## ```
unstable-wgpu-26 = ["i-slint-core/unstable-wgpu-26", "i-slint-backend-selector/unstable-wgpu-26", "dep:wgpu-26"]

## APIs guarded with this feature are *NOT* subject to the usual Slint API stability guarantees, because winit releases new major
## versions more frequently than Slint. This feature as well as the APIs changed or removed in future minor releases of Slint, likely to be replaced
## by a feature with a similar name but the winit version suffix being bumped.
##
## To avoid unintended compilation failures, we recommend to use the [tilde requirement](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/specifying-dependencies.html#tilde-requirements)

## ```
unstable-winit-030 = ["backend-winit", "dep:i-slint-backend-winit", "i-slint-backend-selector/unstable-winit-030"]


## Enable support for exposing [libinput](https://docs.rs/input/latest/input/index.html) related APIs in the LinuxKMS backend.
##
## APIs guarded with this feature are *NOT* subject to the usual Slint API stability guarantees. This feature as well as the APIs changed or removed
