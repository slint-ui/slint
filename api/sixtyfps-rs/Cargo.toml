## Mandatory feature:
## This feature is required to keep the compatibility with SixtyFPS 0.2.0
## Newer patch version may put current functionality behind a new feature
## that would be enabled by default only if this feature was added
compat-0-2-0 = []

## Enable use of the Rust standard library.
std = ["sixtyfps-corelib/std"]

#! ### Backends

## The Qt backend feature uses Qt for the windowing system integration and rendering.
## This backend is required to use the `native` style.
## It requires Qt 5.15 or later to be installed. If Qt is not installed, the
## backend will not be operational
backend-qt = ["sixtyfps-rendering-backend-selector/sixtyfps-rendering-backend-qt", "std"]

## The GL backend uses the `winit` crate for the windowing system integration,
## and the `femtovg` crate for the rendering.
## On unix, at least one of `x11` or `wayland` features must be enabled.
backend-gl = ["sixtyfps-rendering-backend-selector/sixtyfps-rendering-backend-gl", "std"]
## Same as the GL backend, with the `x11` feature of `winit` enabled
x11 = ["sixtyfps-rendering-backend-selector/x11", "backend-gl"]
## Same as the GL backend, with the `wayland` feature of `winit` enabled
wayland = ["sixtyfps-rendering-backend-selector/wayland", "backend-gl"]
