    This is a pseudo module which only exist for documentation purposes as a way to show
    the SixtyFPS documentation as part of rustdoc.

    - The [`generated_code`] module contains an [commented example](generated_code::SampleComponent)
      of what is generated from the `.60` file
    - The [`langref`] module is the reference documentation for the `.60` language.
    - The [`widgets`] and [`builtin_elements`] modules contains the documentation of elements usable
      within the `.60` files
    - The [`layouting`] module contains the documentation to position the elements.
