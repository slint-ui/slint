/**
 * This data structure configures the Slint platform for use with ESP-IDF, in particular
 * the esp_lcd component (
 * https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/stable/esp32/api-reference/peripherals/lcd.html )
 * for touch input and on-screen rendering.
 *
 * Slint supports three different ways of rendering:
 *
 * * Single-buffering: Allocate one frame-buffer at a location of your choosing in RAM, and
 *                     set the `buffer1` field.
 * * Double-buffering: Call `esp_lcd_rgb_panel_get_frame_buffer` to obtain two frame buffers
 *                     allocated by the `esp_lcd` driver and set `buffer1` and `buffer2`.
 * * Line-by-line rendering: Set neither `buffer1` nor `buffer2` to instruct Slint to allocate
 *                           a buffer (with MALLOC_CAP_INTERNAL) big enough to hold one line,
 *                           render into it, and send it to the display. This is an experimental
 *                           feature that requires enabling the `SLINT_FEATURE_EXPERIMENTAL` CMake
 *                           option.
 *
 *  Use single-buffering if you can allocate a buffer in a memory region that allows the esp_lcd
 *  driver to efficiently transfer to the display. Use double-buffering if your driver supports
 *  calling `esp_lcd_rgb_panel_get_frame_buffer` and the buffers can be accessed directly by the
 *  display controller. Use line-by-line rendering if you don't have sufficient memory or rendering
 *  to internal memory (MALLOC_CAP_INTERNAL) and flushing to the display is faster than rendering
 *  into memory buffers that may be slower to access for the CPU.
