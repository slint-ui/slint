# Type Mappings

The types used for properties in `.slint` design markup each translate to specific types in C++.
The follow table summarizes the entire mapping:

```{eval-rst}
===========================  ===================================  =======================================================================================================================================
 :code:`.slint` Type             C++ Type                         Note
===========================  ===================================  =======================================================================================================================================
 :code:`int`                 :code:`int`
 :code:`float`               :code:`float`
 :code:`bool`                :code:`bool`
 :code:`string`              :cpp:class:`slint::SharedString`     A reference-counted string type that uses UTF-8 encoding and can be easily converted to a std::string_view or a :code:`const char *`.
 :code:`color`               :cpp:class:`slint::Color`
 :code:`brush`               :cpp:class:`slint::Brush`
 :code:`image`               :cpp:class:`slint::Image`
 :code:`physical_length`     :code:`float`                        The unit are physical pixels.
 :code:`length`              :code:`float`                        At run-time, logical lengths are automatically translated to physical pixels using the device pixel ratio.
 :code:`duration`            :code:`std::int64_t`                 At run-time, durations are always represented as signed 64-bit integers with millisecond precision.
 :code:`angle`               :code:`float`                        The value in degrees.
 :code:`relative-font-size`  :code:`float`                        Relative font size factor that is multiplied with the :code:`Window.default-font-size` and can be converted to a :code:`length`.
 structure                   A :code:`class` of the same name     The order of the data member are in the same as in the slint declaration
 anonymous object            A :code:`std::tuple`                 The fields are in alphabetical order.
 enum                        An :code:`enum class`                The values are always converted to CamelCase. The order of the values is the same as in the declaration.
 :code:`Point`               :cpp:class:`slint::LogicalPosition`  A struct with :code:`x` and :code:`y` fields, representing logical coordinates. 
===========================  ===================================  =======================================================================================================================================
```
## Structures

The Slint compiler generates a `class` with all data members in
the same order for any user-defined, exported `struct` in the `.slint`
code.

For example, this `struct` in a `.slint` file

```slint,ignore
export struct MyStruct {
    foo: int,
    bar: string,
}
```

will generate the following type in C++:

```cpp
class MyStruct {
public:
    int foo;
    slint::SharedString bar;
};
```

## Enums

The Slint compiler generates an `enum class` with all values in the same order and converted to camel case
for any user-defined, exported `enum` in the `.slint` code.

For example, this `enum` in a `.slint` file

```slint,ignore
export enum MyEnum { alpha, beta-gamma, omicron }
```

will generate the following type in C++:

```cpp
enum class MyEnum { Alpha, BetaGamma, Omicron };
```
