`Slint <https://slint.dev/>`_ is a toolkit to efficiently develop fluid graphical user interfaces for any display: embedded devices and desktop applications.
Slint C++ is the C++ API to interact with a Slint UI from C++.

The .slint Markup Language
=======================

Slint comes with a markup language that is specifically designed for user interfaces. This language provides a
powerful way to describe graphical elements, their placement, and the flow of data through the different states. It is a familiar syntax to describe the hierarchy
of elements and property bindings. Here's the obligatory "Hello World":

.. code-block:: slint,ignore

    export component HelloWorld inherits Window {
        width: 400px;
        height: 400px;

        Text {
           y: parent.width / 2;
           x: parent.x + 200px;
           text: "Hello, world";
           color: blue;
        }
    }

Check out the `Slint Language Documentation <../slint>`_ for more details.

Architecture
============

An application is composed of the business logic written in C++ and the `.slint` user interface design markup, which
is compiled to native code.

Developing
==========

You can create and edit `.slint` files using our `Slint Visual Studio Code Extension <https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Slint.slint>`_,
which features syntax highlighting and live design preview.

For a quick edit and preview cycle, you can also use the :code:`slint-viewer` command line tool, which can be installed using :code:`cargo install slint-viewer`,
if you have `Cargo <https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Slint.slint>`_ installed.

In the next section you will learn how to install the Slint C++ library and the CMake build system integration.
