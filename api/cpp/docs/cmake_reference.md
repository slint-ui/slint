## `slint_target_sources`

```
slint_target_sources(<target> <files>.... [NAMESPACE namespace])
```

Use this function to tell cmake about the .slint files of your application, similar to the builtin cmake [target_sources](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/command/target_sources.html) function.
The function takes care of running the slint-compiler to convert `.slint` files to `.h` files in the build directory,
and extend  the include directories of your target so that the generated file is found when including it in your application.

The optional NAMESPACE argument will put the generated components in the given C++ namespace.

Given a file called `the_window.slint`, the following example will create a file called `the_window.h` that can
be included from your .cpp file. Assuming the `the_window.slint` contains a component `TheWindow`, the output
C++ class will be put in the namespace `ui`, resulting to `ui::TheWindow`.

```cmake
add_executable(my_application main.cpp)
target_link_libraries(my_application PRIVATE Slint::Slint)
slint_target_sources(my_application the_window.slint NAMESPACE ui)
```


## Resource Embedding

By default, images from [`@image-url()`](slint-reference:src/language/syntax/types#images) or fonts that your Slint files reference are loaded from disk at run-time. This minimises build times, but requires that the directory structure with the files remains stable. If you want to build a program that runs anywhere, then you can configure the Slint compiler to embed such sources into the binary.

Set the `SLINT_EMBED_RESOURCES` target property on your CMake target to one of the following values:

* `embed-files`: The raw files are embedded in the application binary.
* `embed-for-software-renderer`: The files will be loaded by the Slint compiler, optimized for use with the software renderer and embedded in the application binary.
* `as-absolute-path`: The paths of files are made absolute and will be used at run-time to load the resources from the file system. This is the default.

This target property is initialised from the global `DEFAULT_SLINT_EMBED_RESOURCES` cache variable. Set it to configure the default for all CMake targets.

```cmake
# Example: when building my_application, specify that the compiler should embed the resources in the binary
set_property(TARGET my_application PROPERTY SLINT_EMBED_RESOURCES embed-files)
```
