# Memory Tile

With the skeleton code in place, this step looks at the first element of the game, the memory tile. It's the
visual building block that consists of an underlying filled rectangle background, the icon image. Later steps add a covering rectangle that acts as a curtain.

Declare the background rectangle as 64 logical pixels wide and tall
filled with a soothing tone of blue.

Note how lengths in Slint have a unit, here, the `px` suffix.
This makes the code easier to read and the compiler can detect when you accidentally
mix values with different units attached to them.

Copy the following code into `ui/appwindow.slint` file, replacing the current content:

```slint
{{#include memory_tile.slint:main_window}}
```

The code exports the <span class="hljs-title">MainWindow</span> component. This is necessary so that the C++ code can access it later for business logic.

Inside the <span class="hljs-built_in">Rectangle</span> place an <span class="hljs-built_in">Image</span> element that
loads an icon with the <span class="hljs-built_in">@image-url()</span> macro. The path is relative to the location of `ui/appwindow.slint`.

You need to install this icon and others you use later first. You can download a pre-prepared
[Zip archive](https://slint.dev/blog/memory-game-tutorial/icons.zip) to the `ui` folder and extract it with the
following commands:

```sh
cd ui
curl -O https://slint.dev/blog/memory-game-tutorial/icons.zip
unzip icons.zip
cd ..
```

This unpacks an `icons` directory containing several icons.

Compile the program with `cmake --build build` and running with the `./build/memory` gives us a
window on the screen that shows the icon of a bus on a blue background.
