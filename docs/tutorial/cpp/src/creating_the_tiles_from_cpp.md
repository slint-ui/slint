# Creating The Tiles From C++

This step places the game tiles randomly.

Change the `main` function and includes in `src/main.cpp` to the following:

```cpp
{{#include main_tiles_from_cpp.cpp:main}}
```

The code takes the list of tiles, duplicates it, and shuffles it, accessing the `memory_tiles` property through the C++ code.

For each top-level property, Slint generates a getter and a setter function. In this case `get_memory_tiles` and `set_memory_tiles`.
Since `memory_tiles` is a Slint array, it's represented as a [`std::shared_ptr<slint::Model>`](https://slint.dev/docs/cpp/api/classslint_1_1model).

You can't change the model generated by Slint, but you can extract the tiles from it and put them
in a [`slint::VectorModel`](https://slint.dev/docs/cpp/api/classslint_1_1vectormodel) which inherits from `Model`.
`VectorModel` lets you make changes and you can use it to replace the static generated model.

Running this code opens a window that now shows a 4 by 4 grid of rectangles, which show or hide
the icons when a player clicks on them.

There's one last aspect missing now, the rules for the game.
