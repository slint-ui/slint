# Game Logic In JavaScript

We'll implement the rules of the game in JavaScript as well. The general philosophy of Slint is that merely the user
interface is implemented in the `.slint` language and the business logic in your favorite programming
language. The game rules shall enforce that at most two tiles have their curtain open. If the tiles match, then we
consider them solved and they remain open. Otherwise we wait for a little while, so the player can memorize
the location of the icons, and then close them again.

We'll modify the `.slint` markup in the `memory.slint` file to signal to the JavaScript code when the user clicks on a tile.
Two changes to <span class="hljs-title">MainWindow</span> are needed: We need to add a way for the MainWindow to call to the JavaScript code that it should
check if a pair of tiles has been solved. And we need to add a property that JavaScript code can toggle to disable further
tile interaction, to prevent the player from opening more tiles than allowed. No cheating allowed! First, we paste
the callback and property declarations into <span class="hljs-title">MainWindow</span>:

```slint
{{#include ../../rust/src/main_game_logic_in_rust.rs:mainwindow_interface}}
```

The last change to the `.slint` markup is to act when the <span class="hljs-title">MemoryTile</span> signals that it was clicked on.
We add the following handler in <span class="hljs-title">MainWindow</span>:

```slint
{{#include ../../rust/src/main_game_logic_in_rust.rs:tile_click_logic}}
```

On the JavaScript side, we can now add an handler to the `check_if_pair_solved` callback, that will check if
two tiles are opened. If they match, the `solved` property is set to true in the model. If they don't
match, start a timer that will close them after one second. While the timer is running, we disable every tile so
one can't click anything during this time.

Insert this code before the `mainWindow.run()` call:

```js
{{#include main_game_logic.js:game_logic}}
```

These were the last changes and running the result gives us a window on the screen that allows us
to play the game by the rules.
