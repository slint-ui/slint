# Getting Started

We assume that you are a somewhat familiar with Rust, and that you know how to create a Rust application with
`cargo new`. The [Rust Getting Started Guide](https://www.rust-lang.org/learn/get-started) can help you get set up.

We recommend using [rust-analyzer](https://rust-analyzer.github.io) and [our editor integrations for `.slint` files](https://github.com/slint-ui/slint/tree/master/editors) for following this tutorial.

First, we create a new cargo project:

```sh
cargo new memory
cd memory
```

Then we edit `Cargo.toml` to add the slint dependency using `cargo add`:

```sh
cargo add slint@1.2.1
```

Finally we copy the hello world program from the [Slint documentation](https://slint.dev/docs/rust/slint/) into our `src/main.rs`:

```rust,noplayground
{{#include main_initial.rs:main}}
```

We run this example with `cargo run` and a window will appear with the green "Hello World" greeting.
