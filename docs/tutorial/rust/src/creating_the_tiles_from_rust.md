# Creating The Tiles From Rust

This step places the game tiles randomly. The code uses the `rand` dependency for the randomization. Add it to the `Cargo.toml` file using the `cargo` command.

```sh
cargo add rand@0.8
```

Change the main function to the following:

```rust,noplayground
{{#include main_tiles_from_rust.rs:tiles}}
```

The code takes the list of tiles, duplicates it, and shuffles it, accessing the `memory_tiles` property through the Rust code.

For each top-level property,
Slint generates a getter and a setter function. In this case `get_memory_tiles` and `set_memory_tiles`.
Since `memory_tiles` is a Slint array, it's represented as a [`Rc<dyn slint::Model>`](https://slint.dev/docs/rust/slint/trait.Model).

You can't change the model generated by Slint, but you can extract the tiles from it and put them
in a [`VecModel`](https://slint.dev/docs/rust/slint/struct.VecModel) which implements the `Model` trait.
`VecModel` lets you make changes and you can use it to replace the static generated model.

Note that you clone the `tiles_model` because you'll use it later to update the game logic.

Running this code opens a window that now shows a 4 by 4 grid of rectangles, which show or hide
the icons when a player clicks on them.

There's one last aspect missing now, the rules for the game.
