# Identifiers

Identifiers can be composed of letter (`a-zA-Z`), of numbers (`0-9`), or of the underscore (`_`) or the dash (`-`).
They cannot start with a number or a dash (but they can start with underscore)
The underscores are normalized to dashes. Which means that these two identifiers are the same: `foo_bar` and `foo-bar`.
