## Colors and Brushes

Color literals follow the syntax of CSS:

```slint,no-preview
export component Example inherits Window {
    background: blue;
    property<color> c1: #ffaaff;
    property<brush> b2: Colors.red;
}
```

In addition to plain colors, many elements have properties that are of type `brush` instead of `color`.
A brush is a type that can be either a color or gradient. The brush is then used to fill an element or
draw the outline.

CSS Color names are only in scope in expressions of type `color` or `brush`. Otherwise, you can access
colors from the `Colors` namespace.

### Methods

All colors and brushes define the following methods:

-   **`brighter(factor: float) -> Brush`**

    Returns a new color derived from this color but has its brightness increased by the specified factor.
    For example if the factor is 0.5 (or for example 50%) the returned color is 50% brighter. Negative factors
    decrease the brightness.

-   **`darker(factor: float) -> Brush`**

    Returns a new color derived from this color but has its brightness decreased by the specified factor.
    For example if the factor is .5 (or for example 50%) the returned color is 50% darker. Negative factors
    increase the brightness.

### Linear Gradients

Linear gradients describe smooth, colorful surfaces. They're specified using an angle and a series of
color stops. The colors will be linearly interpolated between the stops, aligned to an imaginary line
that is rotated by the specified angle. This is called a linear gradient and is specified using the
`@linear-gradient` macro with the following signature:

**`@linear-gradient(angle, color percentage, color percentage, ...)`**

The first parameter to the macro is an angle (see [Types](types.md)). The gradient line's starting point
will be rotated by the specified value.

Following the initial angle is one or multiple color stops, describe as a space separated pair of a
`color` value and a `percentage`. The color specifies which value the linear color interpolation should
reach at the specified percentage along the axis of the gradient.

The following example shows a rectangle that's filled with a linear gradient that starts with a light blue
color, interpolates to a very light shade in the center and finishes with an orange tone:

```slint
export component Example inherits Window {
    preferred-width: 100px;
    preferred-height: 100px;

    Rectangle {
        background: @linear-gradient(90deg, #3f87a6 0%, #ebf8e1 50%, #f69d3c 100%);
    }
}
```

### Radial Gradients

Linear gradiants are like real gradiant but the colors is interpolated in a circle instead of
along a line. To describe a readial gradiant, use the `@radial-gradient` macro with the following signature:

**`@radial-gradient(circle, color percentage, color percentage, ...)`**

The first parameter to the macro is always `circle` because only circular radients are supported.
The syntax is otherwise based on the CSS `radial-gradient` function.

Example:

```slint
export component Example inherits Window {
    preferred-width: 100px;
    preferred-height: 100px;
    Rectangle {
        background: @radial-gradient(circle, #f00 0%, #0f0 50%, #00f 100%);
    }
}
```
