Welcome to the Slint Language Documentation
===========================================

Introduction
------------

The Slint design markup language describes extensible graphical user interfaces using the
`Slint framework <https://slint-ui.com>`_

- Place and compose a tree of visual elements in a window using a textual representation.
- Configure the appearance of elements via properties. For example a `Text` element has a `text`
  property, while a `Rectangle` element has a `background` color.
- Assign binding expressions to properties to automatically compute values that depend on other properties.
- Group binding expressions together with named states and conditions.
- Declare animations on properties and states to make the user interface feel alive.
- Build your own re-usable components and share them in `.slint` module files.
- Define data structures and models and access them from programming languages.
- Build highly customized user interfaces with the :ref:`builtin elements <Builtin Elements>`
  and pre-built :ref:`widgets <Widgets>` provided.

It only describes the user interface and it is not a programming language. The business
logic is written in a different programming language using the Slint API.

Getting Started
---------------

To use `Slint <https://slint-ui.com>`_ you will need to embed your slint files in a project written
in a programming language. Refer to the `Slint documentation specific to that programming language <../>`_
to get started.
