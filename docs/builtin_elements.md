# Builtin Elements

## Common properties

These properties are valid on all visible items

* **`x`** and **`y`** (*length*): the position of the element relative to its parent
* **`z`** (*float*): Allows to specify a different order to stack the items with its siblings. (default: 0)
* **`width`** and **`height`** (*length*): The size of the element. When set, this overrides the default size.
* **`max-width`** and **`max-height`** (*length*): The maximum size of an element when used in a layout.
* **`min-width`** and **`min-height`** (*length*): The minimum size of an element when used in a layout.
* **`preferred-width`** and **`preferred-height`** (*length*): The minimum size of an element when used in a layout.
* **`col`**, **`row`**, **`colspan`**, **`rowspan`** (*int*): See [`GridLayout`](#gridlayout).
* **`horizontal-stretch`** and **`vertical-stretch`** (*float*): Specify how much relative space these elements are stretching in a layout.
  When 0, this means that the elements will not be stretched unless all elements are 0. Builtin widgets have a value of either 0 or 1
* **`opacity`** (*float*): A value between 0 and 1 (or a percentage) that is used to draw the element and its
  children with transparency. 0 is fully transparent (invisible), and 1 is fully opaque. (default: 1)
* **`visible`** (*bool*): When set to `false`, the element and all his children will not be drawn
  and not react to mouse input (default: `true`)


### Drop Shadows

To achieve the graphical effect of a visually elevated shape that shows a shadow effect underneath the frame of
an element, it is possible to set the following `drop-shadow` properties:

* **`drop-shadow-offset-x`** and **`drop-shadow-offset-y`** (*length*): The horizontal and vertical distance
  of the shadow from the element's frame. A negative value places the shadow left / above of the element.
* **`drop-shadow-color`** (*color*): The base color of the shadow to use. Typically that color is the starting color
  of a gradient that fades into transparency.
* **`drop-shadow-blur`** (*length*): The radius of the shadow that also describes the level of blur applied to the shadow.
  Negative values are ignored and zero means no blur (default).

The `drop-shadow` effect is supported for `Rectangle` elements.

## `Window`

Window is the root of what is on the screen

The Window geometry will be restricted by its layout constraints: setting the `width` will result in a fixed width,
and the window manager will respect the `min-width` and `max-width` so the window can't be resized bigger
or smaller. The initial width can be controlled with the `preferred-width` property. The same applies for the height.

### Properties

* **`title`** (*string*): The window title that is shown in the title bar.
* **`icon`** (*image*): The window icon shown in the title bar or the task bar on window managers supporting it.
* **`background`** (*color*): The background color of the Window. (default value: depends on the style)
* **`default-font-family`** (*string*): The font family to use as default in text elements inside this window, that don't
  have their family set.
* **`default-font-size`** (*length*): The font size to use as default in text elements inside this window, that don't
  have their size set.
* **`default-font-weight`** (*int*): The font weight to use as default in text elements inside this window, that don't
  have their weight set. The values range from 100 (lightest) to 900 (thickest). 400 is the normal weight.

## `Rectangle`

By default, the rectangle is just an empty item that shows nothing. By setting a color or a border
it is then possible to draw a simple rectangle on the screen

When not part of a layout, its width or height defaults to 100% of the parent element when not specified.

### Properties

* **`background`** (*brush*): The background brush of the Rectangle, typically a color. (default value: transparent)
* **`border-width`** (*length*): The width of the border. (default value: 0)
* **`border-color`** (*brush*): The color of the border. (default value: transparent)
* **`border-radius`** (*length*): The size of the radius. (default value: 0)
* **`clip`** (*bool*): By default, when an item is bigger or outside another item, it is still shown.
  But when this property is set to `true`, then the children element of this Rectangle are going
  to be clipped. (default: `false`)

### Example

```60
Example := Window {
    width: 270px;
    height: 100px;

    Rectangle {
        x: 10px;
        y: 10px;
        width: 50px;
        height: 50px;
        background: blue;
    }

    // Rectangle with a border
    Rectangle {
        x: 70px;
        y: 10px;
        width: 50px;
        height: 50px;
        background: green;
        border-width: 2px;
        border-color: red;
    }

    // Transparent Rectangle with a border and a radius
    Rectangle {
        x: 140px;
        y: 10px;
        width: 50px;
        height: 50px;
        border-width: 4px;
        border-color: black;
        border-radius: 10px;
    }

    // A radius of width/2 makes it a circle
    Rectangle {
        x: 210px;
        y: 10px;
        width: 50px;
        height: 50px;
        background: yellow;
        border-width: 2px;
        border-color: blue;
        border-radius: width/2;
    }
}
```

## `Image`

An Image can be used to represent an image loaded from an image file.

### Properties

* **`source`** (*image*): The image to load. In order to reference image, one uses the `@image-url("...")` macro
  which loads the file relative to the directory containing the .60 file.
* **`source-clip-x`**, **`source-clip-y`**, **`source-clip-width`**, **`source-clip-height`** (*int*): properties in source
  image coordinates that, when specified, can be used to render only a portion of the specified image.
* **`image-fit`** (*enum*): Specifies how the source image shall be fit into the image element. Possible values are:
  * `fill`: Scales and stretches the image to fit the width and height of the element.
  * `contain`: The source image is scaled to fit into the image element's dimension while preserving the aspect ratio.
  * `cover`: The source image is scaled to cover into the image element's dimension while preserving the aspect ratio.

  When the `Image` element is part of a layout, the default value for **`image-fit`** is `contain`. Otherwise it is `fill`.

* **`colorize`** (*brush*): When set, the image is used as an alpha mask and is drown in the given color (or with the gradient)
* **`width`**, **`height`** (*length*): The width and height of the image as it appears on the screen.The default values are
  the sizes provided by the **`source`** image. If the `Image` is **not** in a layout and only **one** of the two sizes are
  specified, then the other defaults to the specified value scaled according to the aspect ratio of the **`source`** image.

### Example

```60
Example := Window {
    VerticalLayout {
        Image {
            source: @image-url("https://sixtyfps.io/resources/logo_scaled.png");
            // image-fit default is `contain` when in layout, preserving aspect ratio
        }
        Image {
            source: @image-url("https://sixtyfps.io/resources/logo_scaled.png");
            colorize: red;
        }
    }
}
```

Scaled while preserving the aspect ratio:

```60
Example := Window {
    Image {
        source: @image-url("https://sixtyfps.io/resources/logo_scaled.png");
        width: 270px;
        // implicit default, preserving aspect ratio: height: self.width * natural_height / natural_width;
    }
}
```

## `Text`

The `Text` element is responsible for rendering text. Besides the `text` property, that specifies which text to render,
it also allows configuring different visual aspects through the `font-family`, `font-size`, `font-weight` and `color` properties.

The `Text` element can break long text into multiple lines of text. A line feed character (`\n`) in the string of the `text`
property will trigger a manual line break. For automatic line breaking you need to set the `wrap` property to a value other than
`no-wrap` and it is important to specify a `width` and `height` for the `Text` element, in order to know where to break. It's
recommended to place the `Text` element in a layout and let it set the `width` and `height` based on the available screen space
and the text itself.

### Properties

* **`text`** (*string*): The actual text.
* **`font-family`** (*string*): The font name
* **`font-size`** (*length*): The font size of the text
* **`font-weight`** (*int*): The weight of the font. The values range from 100 (lightest) to 900 (thickest). 400 is the normal weight.
* **`color`** (*brush*): The color of the text (default: black)
* **`horizontal-alignment`** (*enum [`TextHorizontalAlignment`](#texthorizontalalignment)*): The horizontal alignment of the text.
* **`vertical-alignment`** (*enum [`TextVerticalAlignment`](#textverticalalignment)*): The vertical alignment of the text.
* **`wrap`** (*enum [`TextWrap`](#textwrap)*): The way the text wraps (default: no-wrap).
* **`overflow`** (*enum [`TextOverflow`](#textoverflow)*): What happens when the text overflows (default: clip).
* **`letter-spacing`** (*length*): The letter spacing allows changing the spacing between the glyphs. A positive value increases the spacing
  and a negative value decreases the distance. The default value is 0.

### Example

This example shows the text "Hello World" in red, using the default font:

```60
Example := Window {
    width: 270px;
    height: 100px;

    Text {
        text: "Hello World";
        color: red;
    }
}
```

This example breaks a longer paragraph of text into multiple lines, by setting a `wrap`
policy and assigning a limited `width` and enough `height` for the text to flow down:

```60
Example := Window {
    width: 270px;
    height: 300px;

    Text {
        text: "This paragraph breaks into multiple lines of text";
        wrap: word-wrap;
        width: 150px;
        height: 100%;
    }
}
```

## `Path`

The `Path` element allows rendering a generic shape, composed of different geometric commands. A path
shape can be filled and outlined.

When not part of a layout, its width or height defaults to 100% of the parent element when not specified.

A path can be defined in two different ways:

* Using SVG path commands as a string
* Using path command elements in `.60` markup.

The coordinates used in the geometric commands are within the imaginary coordinate system of the path.
When rendering on the screen, the shape is drawn relative to the `x` and `y` properties. If the `width`
and `height` properties are non-zero, then the entire shape is fit into these bounds - by scaling
accordingly.

### Common Path Properties

* **`fill`** (*brush*): The color for filling the shape of the path.
* **`fill-rule`** (enum *[`FillRule`](#fillrule)*): The fill rule to use for the path. (default value: `nonzero`)
* **`stroke`** (*brush*): The color for drawing the outline of the path.
* **`stroke-width`** (*length*): The width of the outline.
* **`width`** (*length*): If non-zero, the path will be scaled to fit into the specified width.
* **`height`** (*length*): If non-zero, the path will be scaled to fit into the specified height.
* **`viewbox-x`**/**`viewbox-y`**/**`viewbox-width`**/**`viewbox-height`** (*float*) These four
  properties allow defining the position and size of the viewport of the path in path coordinates.

  If the `viewbox-width` or `viewbox-height` is less or equal than zero, the viewbox properties are
  ignored and instead the bounding rectangle of all path elements is used to define the view port.
* **`clip`** (*bool*): By default, when a path has a view box defined and the elements render
  outside of it, they are still rendered. When this property is set to `true`, then rendering will be
  clipped at the boundaries of the view box.
  This property must be a literal `true` or `false` (default: `false`)

#### Path Using SVG commands

SVG is a popular file format for defining scalable graphics, which are often composed of paths. In SVG
paths are composed using [commands](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Attribute/d#path_commands),
which in turn are written in a string literal. In `.60` the path commands are provided to the `commands`
property. The following example renders a shape consists of an arc and a rectangle, composed of `line-to`,
`move-to` and `arc` commands:

```60
Example := Path {
    width: 100px;
    height: 100px;
    commands: "M 0 0 L 0 100 A 1 1 0 0 0 100 100 L 100 0 Z";
    stroke: red;
    stroke-width: 1px;
}
```

The commands are provided in a property:

* **`commands`** (*string): A string literal providing the commands according to the SVG path specification.

#### Path Using SVG Path Elements

The shape of the path can also be described using elements that resemble the SVG path commands but use the
`.60` markup syntax. The earlier example using SVG commands can also be written like that:

```60
Example := Path {
    width: 100px;
    height: 100px;
    stroke: blue;
    stroke-width: 1px;

    MoveTo {
        x: 0;
        y: 0;
    }
    LineTo {
        x: 0;
        y: 100;
    }
    ArcTo {
        radius-x: 1;
        radius-y: 1;
        x: 100;
        y: 100;
    }
    LineTo {
        x: 100;
        y: 0;
    }
    Close {
    }
}
```

Note how the coordinates of the path elements do not use units - they operate within the imaginary
coordinate system of the scalable path.

##### `MoveTo` Sub-element for `Path`

The `MoveTo` sub-element closes the current sub-path, if present, and moves the current point
to the location specified by the `x` and `y` properties. Subsequent elements such as `LineTo`
will use this new position as their starting point, therefore this starts a new sub-path.

###### Properties

* **`x`** (*float*): The x position of the new current point.
* **`y`** (*float*): The y position of the new current point.

##### `LineTo` Sub-element for `Path`

The `LineTo` sub-element describes a line from the path's current position to the
location specified by the `x` and `y` properties.

###### Properties

* **`x`** (*float*): The target x position of the line.
* **`y`** (*float*): The target y position of the line.

##### `ArcTo` Sub-element for `Path`

The `ArcTo` sub-element describes the portion of an ellipse. The arc is drawn from the path's
current position to the location specified by the `x` and `y` properties. The remaining properties
are modelled after the SVG specification and allow tuning visual features such as the direction
or angle.

###### Properties

* **`x`** (*float*): The target x position of the line.
* **`y`** (*float*): The target y position of the line.
* **`radius-x`** (*float*): The x-radius of the ellipse.
* **`radius-y`** (*float*): The y-radius of the ellipse.
* **`x-rotation`** (*float*): The x-axis of the ellipse will be rotated by the value of this
  properties, specified in as angle in degrees from 0 to 360.
* **`large-arc`** (*bool*): Out of the two arcs of a closed ellipse, this flag selects that the
  larger arc is to be rendered. If the property is `false`, the shorter arc is rendered instead.
* **`sweep`** (*bool*): If the property is `true`, the arc will be drawn as a clockwise turning arc;
  anti-clockwise otherwise.

##### `CubicTo` Sub-element for `Path`

The `CubicTo` sub-element describes a smooth Bézier from the path's current position to the
location specified by the `x` and `y` properties, using two control points specified by their
respective properties.

###### Properties

* **`control-y`** (*float*): The y coordinate of the curve's control point.

##### `Close` Sub-element for `Path`

The `Close` element closes the current sub-path and draws a straight line from the current
position to the beginning of the path.

## `TouchArea`

The TouchArea control what happens when the zone covered by it is touched or interacted with
using the mouse.

When not part of a layout, its width or height default to 100% of the parent element if not specified.

        clicked => {
            rect2.background = #ff0;
        }
    }
    Rectangle {
        width: parent.width / 2;
        height: parent.height;
        background: area.pressed ? blue: red;
    }
    rect2 := Rectangle {
        x: parent.width / 2;
        width: parent.width / 2;
        height: parent.height;
    }
}
```

## `FocusScope`

The FocusScope exposes callback to intercept the pressed key when it has focus.

            debug(event.text);
            if (event.modifiers.control) {
                debug("control was pressed during this event");
            }
            accept
        }
    }
}
```

## `VerticalLayout` / `HorizontalLayout`

These layouts place their children next to each other vertically or horizontally.
The size of elements can either be fixed with the `width` or `height` property, or if they are not set
they will be computed by the layout respecting the minimum and maximum sizes and the stretch factor.

## Properties

* **`spacing`** (*length*): The distance between the elements in the layout.
* **`padding`** (*length*): the padding within the layout.
* **`padding-left`**, **`padding-right`**, **`padding-top`** and **`padding-bottom`** (*length*):
  override the padding in specific sides.
* **`alignment`** (*FIXME enum*): Can be one of  `stretch`, `center`, `start`, `end`,
  `space-between`, `space-around`. Defaults to `stretch`. Matches the CSS flex.

## Example

```60
Foo := Window {
    width: 200px;
    height: 100px;
    HorizontalLayout {
        spacing: 5px;
        Rectangle { background: red; width: 10px; }
        Rectangle { background: blue; min-width: 10px; }
        Rectangle { background: yellow; horizontal-stretch: 1; }
        Rectangle { background: green; horizontal-stretch: 2; }
    }
}
```

## `GridLayout`

`GridLayout` places the elements in a grid. `GridLayout` adds properties to each item: `col`, `row`, `colspan`, `rowspan`.
You can control the position of elements with `col` and `row`.
If `col` or `row` is not specified, they are automatically computed such that the item is next to the previous item, in the same row.
Alternatively, the item can be put in a `Row` element.

### Properties

* **`spacing`** (*length*): The distance between the elements in the layout.
* **`padding`** (*length*): the padding within the layout.
* **`padding-left`**, **`padding-right`**, **`padding-top`** and **`padding-bottom`** (*length*):
  override the padding in specific sides.

### Examples

This example uses the `Row` element

```60
Foo := Window {
    width: 200px;
    height: 200px;
    GridLayout {
        spacing: 5px;
        Row {
            Rectangle { background: red; }
            Rectangle { background: blue; }
        }
        Row {
            Rectangle { background: yellow; }
            Rectangle { background: green; }
        }
    }
}
```

This example uses the `col` and `row` properties

```60
Foo := Window {
    width: 200px;
    height: 150px;
    GridLayout {
        Rectangle { background: red; }
        Rectangle { background: blue; }
        Rectangle { background: yellow; row: 1; }
        Rectangle { background: green; }
        Rectangle { background: black; col: 2; row: 0; }
    }
}
```

# Builtin Structures

## `KeyEvent`

This structure is generated and passed to the key press and release
callbacks of the `FocusScope` element.

### Fields

* **`text`** (*string*): The string representation of the key
* **`modifiers`** (*KeyboardModifiers*): The keyboard modifiers pressed during the event

## `KeyboardModifiers`

This structure is generated as part of `KeyEvent`, to indicate which modifier keys
are pressed during the generation of a key event.
