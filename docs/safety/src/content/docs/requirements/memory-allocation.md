description: Static memory allocation requirement for Slint SC.
---

According to the standard, Slint SC should not perform dynamic memory allocation during the continuous rendering loop. All memory pools, vertex buffers, and command buffers should be pre-allocated.

Slint SC is written in `no_std` rust, so it does not use the standard library. However, it currently does make use of a global allocator. This is a **known issue** (bugID?) that we plan to address in the future.

**(Reference: ISO 26262-6 Annex D.2.2 "Memory management", which identifies "unbounded memory consumption" and "memory leaks" as interference faults.)**
