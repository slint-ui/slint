title: "SR_TEST_COVERAGE"
description: Test coverage requirement for Slint SC.
---

Slint SC must support headless or offline automated testing frameworks capable of running on CI/CD pipelines to verify layout engines, event propagation, and state transitions.

Code coverage is highly measurable in Rust using LLVM source-based coverage tools such as `cargo-tarpaulin` or `grcov`. The goal for ASIL D is typically strict structural coverage, requiring >90% statement/branch coverage and often Modified Condition/Decision Coverage (MC/DC).
