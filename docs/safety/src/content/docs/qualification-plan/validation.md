description: Running and understanding Slint SC safety-critical tests.
---

Validation involves running a set of tests, which is done by the Validator Tool.

The requirements for the Validator Tool are described in ISO26262-8 Clause 11.4.9.
In the case of Slint SC, the Validator Tool is the `cargo test` command.
This command runs the tests and generates a report. These tests are triggered automatically
from the CI system and also on demand during the validation process.
