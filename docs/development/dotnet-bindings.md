## Overview

The .NET bindings follow the same shape as the Python and Node.js bindings:

| Part | Python | Node.js | .NET |
|---|---|---|---|
| Native crate wrapping `slint-interpreter` | `api/python/slint` | `api/node` | `api/dotnet/native` |
| Idiomatic host-language layer | `api/python/slint/slint/` | `api/node/typescript/` | `api/dotnet/Slint/` |
| Typed code generator | `generator/python.rs` | `generator/typescript.rs` | `generator/csharp.rs` (planned) |
| `tests/cases` driver | `tests/driver/python` | `tests/driver/nodejs` | `tests/driver/dotnet` (planned) |

The managed library targets `net10.0` and is AOT-compatible.

The bindings don't reuse `internal/interpreter/ffi.rs`.
That module exposes C++ layouts such as `SharedString` and `StructOpaque`,
which C# would have to mirror byte for byte.
`api/dotnet/native` instead exports a handle-based C ABI designed for P/Invoke.

## Layout

```
api/dotnet/
├── native/          # Rust crate `slint-dotnet`, builds libslint_dotnet.{dylib,so,dll}
├── Slint/           # C# library `Slint.csproj`
├── Slint.Tests/     # MSTest tests on Microsoft.Testing.Platform
└── Slint.slnx
```

## Native ABI

Every export in `api/dotnet/native` follows these rules:

- An object crosses the boundary as an opaque pointer from `Box::into_raw`,
  and each type has a matching `slint_dotnet_<type>_free`.
  C# wraps each one in a `SafeHandle`.
- Strings passed in are UTF-8 pointer and length pairs.
- Strings passed out are `OwnedString` structs, returned by value and released with `slint_dotnet_string_free`.
  Neither side frees memory the other allocated.
- A fallible function returns `bool`, or null for a pointer.
  `slint_dotnet_last_error` then returns the message for the current thread,
  and C# throws `SlintException`.
- Each export runs inside `catch_unwind`, since unwinding into managed code aborts the process.
  Release builds use `panic = "abort"`, so there a panic still aborts.
- A managed callback is a function pointer plus a `GCHandle` as user data.
  Rust calls the drop function pointer when it drops the closure, which frees the `GCHandle`.
- Slint objects are `!Send`.
  The first call claims the Slint thread and creates the platform there.
  Calls from any other thread fail with an error.
- Objects released on another thread, such as by the .NET finalizer, are dropped on the Slint thread through `invoke_from_event_loop`.
- An exception thrown by a .NET callback is kept until the native call returns, then rethrown.
  Inside the event loop, it also stops the loop, and `EventLoop.Run` rethrows it.

C# declares the exports with `[LibraryImport]` in `Slint/Interop/NativeMethods.cs`.

## Value Mapping

| Slint | C# |
|---|---|
| `string` | `string` |
| `int`, `float`, `length`, `duration`, … | `double` |
| `bool` | `bool` |
| `color`, solid `brush` | `Slint.Color` |
| struct | `Slint.Struct` |
| array, model | `Slint.Model<T>`; any `IEnumerable` converts to a copy |
| enum | `Slint.EnumValue` |
| anything else, such as an image or a gradient | `Slint.OpaqueValue`, passed back unchanged |

Generated code narrows the numeric types and maps structs and enums to C# records and enums.

## Models

A `Slint.Model<T>` that Slint uses is wrapped in a `ManagedModel` in `api/dotnet/native/models.rs`.
The `ManagedModel` holds a strong `GCHandle`, so Slint keeps the .NET model alive.
The .NET model holds only a `Weak` to the `ManagedModel`, to notify Slint of changes.
There's no strong reference back, so nothing forms a cycle across the two heaps.
Once Slint drops the model, a later conversion creates a new `ManagedModel`.

Reading a model property returns the original .NET object.
A model that Slint created, such as an array literal, comes back as a `Model<object?>` over the native value.

## Threading and macOS

winit and AppKit need the event loop on the process main thread.
A console app's `Main` runs there, so call `EventLoop.Run()` from `Main`.

While the loop runs, `SynchronizationContext.Current` is a `SlintSynchronizationContext`,
which posts through `invoke_from_event_loop`.
So `await` in a callback continues on the Slint thread,
and `EventLoop.Run(Func<Task>)` runs an `async` main function until it completes.

Hiding the last window queues a quit, even while the loop isn't running.
The next `EventLoop.Run` then returns right away.

Test runners call tests from thread pool threads.
`Slint.Tests` runs every test on one dedicated thread and uses the testing backend
(`SLINT_BACKEND=testing`, crate feature `backend-testing`).

## Lifetime

A callback that captures its own `ComponentInstance` forms a cycle:
Rust holds a `GCHandle` to the delegate, and the delegate holds the instance.
Dispose the instance explicitly, or capture a `WeakReference` in the callback.

## Building and Testing

```sh
cargo build -p slint-dotnet --features backend-testing
SLINT_BACKEND=testing dotnet test --project api/dotnet/Slint.Tests
```

`Slint.csproj` copies `target/debug/libslint_dotnet.*` to the output of every project that references it.
Build with `-p:SlintCargoProfile=release` to use the release build instead,
and rebuild the C# project after building the native library for the first time.
At run time, `SLINT_DOTNET_NATIVE_LIBRARY` overrides the library path.

## Roadmap

1. Native crate and C# library: compile from a string or file, properties, callbacks, functions, globals, event loop (done).
2. Models, timers, `async` through a `SynchronizationContext`, lifetime tests (done).
3. `-f csharp` generator, MSBuild `<SlintFile>` items, API match check, `tests/driver/dotnet`.
4. CI workflow, user documentation, an example, NuGet packages per runtime identifier.
