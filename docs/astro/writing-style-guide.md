# Writing Style Guide

Use this style guide as a check list when reviewing / writing:

  - documentation
  - blog posts
  - posts on social media

## Objective

In our written communication we aim to be:

  - concise: It's common to skim through text these days.
  - easily understood: Simple terms, phrases, and words reach a wider audience.
  - informal: We're not a big corporation, we need to appear as a small, human company.

## Guidance

 1. Use contractions:
   Avoid: "We are proud to announce ..."
   Use: "We're proud to announce ..."
   Rationale: Makes for a conversational, human tone.

 2. Offer direct advice:
   - Avoid: "Please install XYZ ..."
   - Use: "Install XYZ"
   - Rational: The user is reading this to get instructions, there's no need to beat around the bush.

 3. Write actionable:
   - Avoid: "Element XYZ makes it possible to set the background color."
   - Use: "Use element XYZ to set the background color."
   - Rationale: Shorter, straight to the point.

 4. Don't shout.
   - Avoid: "Try out XYZ!"
   - Use: "Try out XYZ."
   - Rationale: Use exclamation points sparingly, save them for when they really count. We already have the attention of the reader.

 5. Use Title Case for headings.

 6. Use active voice for things *we* did, for example in blog posts.
   - Avoid: "The foo widget got revamped."
   - Use: "We revamped the foo widget."
   - Rationale: We're not joining the audience on the observer's bench, we're announcing the result of our work.

## Docs

  - Ensure links don't go to blank pages e.g. [1.7 concepts](https://releases.slint.dev/1.7.0/docs/slint/src/language/concepts/)


## Tabs
The dev-platform tabs should be in the following order:
- Windows
- macOS
- Linux
