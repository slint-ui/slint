The platform descriptions below cover what has been tested for deployment. For the development environment,
we recommend using a recent desktop operating system and compiler version.

See the documentation of the <LangRefLink lang="rust-slint" relpath="android/">android module in our Rust API documentation</LangRefLink>.
