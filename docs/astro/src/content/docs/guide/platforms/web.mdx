description: Running Slint on the Web with Wasm
---

While Slint is mainly designed for native applications (desktop, embedded, mobile),
it can also run in a web browser using WebAssembly (Wasm).

:::caution[Caution]
Currently, only the Rust language is supported when targeting the web, and the only renderer available is FemtoVG.
:::

This renderer draws the UI into a `<canvas>` element on the page.
The rendering happens entirely within the canvas, so Slint does not rely on the browser's DOM or CSS engine.
This makes it possible to have a consistent look across platforms, but also introduces some limitations:

* Slint handles its own font rendering, so it does not benefit from the browser's text rendering.
* Accessibility features (such as screen readers) are not available.
* The UI does not behave like a typical web application, since it doesn't use standard HTML elements.

Because of these trade-offs, running Slint in the browser is currently not recommended for building general-purpose web applications.
Instead, it is best suited for:

* Demos and examples that can run directly in the browser without requiring installation.
* Applications where the web is not the primary platform, but a consistent UI is still needed.
* Tools or dashboards where native-style rendering is more important than web integration.

In the future, we plan to explore a renderer that uses the DOM directly, but this is not currently the focus.

## Building for WebAssembly

To compile and run a Slint application in the browser, you will use
[`wasm-bindgen`](https://rustwasm.github.io/docs/wasm-bindgen/) and [`wasm-pack`](https://rustwasm.github.io/wasm-pack/).

The tutorial has a chapter for a step-by-step walkthrough.

Below is a summary of the main steps:

In your `Cargo.toml`, set the crate type to `"cdylib"` and add `wasm-bindgen` as a dependency for the `wasm32` target:

```toml
[lib]
#...
crate-type = ["cdylib"]

[target.'cfg(target_arch = "wasm32")'.dependencies]
wasm-bindgen = { version = "0.2" }
```

Use the `wasm-bindgen(start)` attribute to mark the application's entry point.
The UI is created and run as usual:

```rust
#[cfg(target_arch = "wasm32")]
use wasm_bindgen::prelude::*;

slint::include_modules!(); // or slint!(...)

#[cfg_attr(target_arch = "wasm32", wasm_bindgen(start))]
pub fn main() {
    // Usual application code
    let main_window = MainWindow::new().unwrap();
    main_window.run().unwrap();
}
```

Build the application using wasm-pack:

```bash
wasm-pack build --release --target web
```

This creates a `pkg/` directory with `.wasm` and `.js` files, including a JavaScript file named after your package.

The wasm binary can be imported in a HTML file.
Slint expects a `<canvas>` HTML element with `id = "canvas"`.

```html
<canvas id="canvas"></canvas>
<script type="module">
  import init from "./pkg/YOUR_APPLICATION.js";
  init();
</script>
```

Replace `YOUR_APPLICATION` with the name of your crate.

Note that Wasm files can only be loaded in trusted contexts, so you may need to serve the files from a web server.

## Clipboard Support in TextInput

Slint's `TextInput` component supports copy and paste when running in the browser.
This is implemented using the browser's clipboard API via the `web-sys` crate.
Because the clipboard API in `web-sys` is still unstable, you need to opt in by setting the following environment variable when building:

```bash
RUSTFLAGS=--cfg=web_sys_unstable_apis
```

You can read more in the [`web-sys` unstable APIs documentation](https://rustwasm.github.io/docs/wasm-bindgen/web-sys/unstable-apis.html).
