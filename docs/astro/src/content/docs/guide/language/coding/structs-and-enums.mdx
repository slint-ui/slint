## Structs

Define named structures using the `struct` keyword:

```slint
export struct Player  {
    name: string,
    score: int,
}

export component Example {
    in-out property<Player> player: { name: "Foo", score: 100 };
}
```

The default value of a struct, is initialized with all its fields set to their default value.

### Anonymous Structures

Declare anonymous structures using `{ identifier1: type1, identifier2: type2 }`
syntax, and initialize them using
`{ identifier1: expression1, identifier2: expression2  }`.

You may have a trailing `,` after the last expression or type.

```slint
export component Example {
    in-out property<{name: string, score: int}> player: { name: "Foo", score: 100 };
    in-out property<{a: int, }> foo: { a: 3 };
}
```

## Enums

Define an enumeration with the `enum` keyword:

```slint
export enum CardSuit { clubs, diamonds, hearts, spade }

export component Example {
    in-out property<CardSuit> card: spade;
    out property<bool> is-clubs: card == CardSuit.clubs;
}
```

Enum values can be referenced by using the name of the enum and the name of the value
separated by a dot. (eg: `CardSuit.spade`)

The name of the enum can be omitted in bindings of the type of that enum, or if the
return value of a callback is of that enum.

The default value of each enum type is always the first value.
