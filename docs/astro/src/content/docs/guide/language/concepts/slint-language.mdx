This following section gives you an insight into the thinking behind the language and the core concepts it's made up from.

As covered in the video above, the Slint declarative UI language is designed to be a simple, yet powerful way to create
any user interface you can imagine.

```slint
Text {
    text: "Hello World!";
    font-size: 24px;
    color: #0044ff;
}
```

This example shows the core of how Slint works. Use elements with their name followed by open and closed braces,
e.g. `Text {}`. Then within the braces customize it with properties e.g. `font-size: 24px`.

To nest elements inside each other place them within the parents braces. For example the following
`Rectangle` has a `Text` element as its child.

<CodeSnippetMD imagePath="/src/assets/generated/intro-nesting.png" scale="3" imageWidth="200" imageHeight="200" imageAlt='Image showing text nested inside a rectangle'>

```slint
Rectangle {
    width: 150px;
    height: 60px;
    background: white;
    border-radius: 10px;

    Text {
        text: "Hello World!";
        font-size: 24px;
        color: black;
    }
}
```

</CodeSnippetMD>

The final core part are binding expressions:

```slint showLineNumbers=true {10}
property <int> counter: 0;

Rectangle {
    width: 150px;
    height: 60px;
    background: white;
    border-radius: 10px;

    Text {
        text: "Count: " + counter;
        font-size: 24px;
        color: black;
    }

    TouchArea {
        clicked => {
            counter += 1;
        }
    }
}
```

In this example a property called `counter` is declared. Then the `Rectangle` has a
`TouchArea` inside, that automatically fills its parent and responds to clicks or taps. On click
it increments `counter`. Here is where the magic of fine grained reactivity comes in.

The `Text` element's `text` property depends on the `counter` property. When `counter` changes, the UI is automatically
updated. There's no need to opt in. In Slint every expression is automatically re-evaluated. However this
is done in a performant way that only updates expressions where the dependencies have changed.

Slint makes it trivial to create your own components by composing together the built in elements or other components.
`Text` and `Rectangles` can become buttons. Buttons and input fields can become forms or dialogs. Forms and dialogs can become Views.
And finally Views combine to become applications.

```slint no-test
export component MyView {
    MyDialog {
        title: "Can UI Development Be Easy?";

        MyButton {
            text: "Yes";
        }
    }
}
```

With practice you can reduce any level of complexity to simple, maintainable UI components.



## Why Slint?

The objective of the concepts section of the guide is to give you an overview of the language from a high level. If you want to
dive straight in the details then check out the <Link type="slintFile" label="coding section"/> and the language reference
sections.

The Slint language describes your application's User Interface in a declarative way.

A User Interface is quite different from abstract code. It's made up
of text, images, colors, animations, and so on. Even though it's a mirage, the buttons and elements do not
really exist in the physical world, it's meant to look and behave as if it does. Buttons have pressed effects,
lists can be flicked and behave as if they had real inertia. When being designed they are described in terms
of UI components, forms, and views.

Meanwhile the world of code is a quite different abstraction. It's made up of functions, variables, and so on.
Even when some aspects of a UI exist such as buttons and menus they also go hand in hand with a lot of code to
manage the implementation details.

```js
const button = document.createElement('button');
button.textContent = 'Click me';
document.body.appendChild(button);
```

Take this simple web example. A button is created. Then a property to show 'Click me' text is text. At this point
technically the button exists, but it won't show up as its not attached to anything. So the final line
makes it a child of the main view.

```js
const buttonWithListener = document.createElement('button');
buttonWithListener.textContent = 'Click me';
buttonWithListener.addEventListener('click', () => {
    console.log('Button clicked!');
});
document.body.appendChild(buttonWithListener);
```

In this second example a button is created and an event listener is added. Within that is a callback
function to log out that the button is pressed. It's a lot of code to do simple things.

It's quite abstract. For example once a few more buttons and components are added its almost impossible
to be able to think how the real interface would look. It's hard to think about the design of a UI
using this kind of code.

It's also too complex to edit without understanding how to code. This means UI designers cannot work
hands on to ensure all their design intent is implemented. They are forced to use other tools and frameworks
to create prototypes and design guides that may look or behave differently to the actual UI implementation.
It doesn't have to be this way.

## Declarative Style

There have been attempts to make describing a UI in code more declarative. For example [React](https://reactjs.org/)
and [SwiftUI](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/swiftui/).


```jsx
function ContentView() {
  return (
    <p style={{ fontSize: '2rem', color: 'green' }}>
      Hello World
    </p>
  );
}
```

```swift
struct ContentView: View {
    var body: some View {
        Text("Hello World")
            .font(.title)
            .foregroundColor(.green)
    }
}
```

These languages take normal code and let it be used in a declarative way. But it's
still functions with arguments that act as properties. It is simpler and behavior
such as parent child relationships can be inferred.

For Slint, instead of tweaking a normal language to be more declarative, we
created a pure declarative language from the ground up.


## The Business Logic Problem

One attempt to solve the problem of describing a UI in code has been to create a separate static markup language.
Platforms such as Android and [WPF](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/desktop/wpf/) have done this. The UI
is described in an XML-like format. While the rest of the code is written in both a separate language and also
separate files. Known as a code behind file. The issue here is that XML, despite claims to the contrary, is not
human readable or editable. It's also too static and rigid and it can be frustrating to jump between the UI file
and the separate code behind file to describe the behavior of the UI.

Meanwhile the React web framework has solved this problem by using JSX. HTML, CSS and JavaScript can be mixed
together in a single file. On one hand this is great as it means you can use the same language to describe the UI
layout and behavior. On the other hand there is no limit to what code you can put in a JSX file. Logic for handling
network requests, processing data and pretty much anything quickly ends up mixed in with UI code. It leads to the
issue where it can be fast to create an initial application, but it becomes so hard to maintain it that it's too
slow or costly to evolve the application.

## A True Declarative UI Language

Slint provides a declarative language to describe an application's user interface

```slint showLineNumbers=true no-test
Rectangle {
    Button {
        text: "Click me!";
        clicked => {
            debug("Button clicked!");
        }
    }
}
```

If you can understand this Slint code — you've already grasped a majority of how simple to use the language is.
On line 2 we declare a `Button`. On line 3 we set its `text` property to `"Click me!"` and on line 4
we set a callback to print out "Button clicked!" to the console via the built in `debug` function.

The Slint compiler will take this code and see that it needs to generate a Rectangle that has a Button as a child.
Similarly, when the clicked callback activates, it will run the `debug` function. There is no need to think
about component and event listener life cycles.

With the Slint language you can think much more closely to how a user interface looks and behaves. Instead of
describing the 'how', the how should the details be implemented in traditional code, you "declare" how
the interface should look and behave. Hence Slint being a 'declarative UI language'.

It's not only simpler for software developers to use, it's also now something designers can potentially edit or
more easily contribute to.

Slint isn't the first declarative UI language, but it takes advantage of being able to learn from earlier more
complex attempts that hinted at the potential of a declarative UI language to finalize into a modern and complete
system.

At first glance it has the simplicity of a static markup language, but with a modern take that removes things like
angle brackets and tags. But also dynamic features such as complex property expressions, functions, callbacks,
and automatic reactivity. However these can only be used in the context of what helps a UI component. If you want
to make network requests, process data, or many other things that count as 'business logic' then those have to live
in separate files written in Rust, C++, JavaScript, etc. Slint allows you to express any UI and only the UI.

It then provides a system of adapters to allow the business logic side of the app to easily communicate with the UI
and visa versa.
