To install the Slint Language server, check the <Link type="SlintLSP" label="LSP Documentation"/>.

To setup the LSP:

1. Make sure the slint language server is installed
2. Using Package Control in Sublime Text, install the LSP package ([sublimelsp/LSP](https://github.com/sublimelsp/LSP))
3. Download the Slint syntax highlighting files into your User Package folder,
   e.g. on macOS `~/Library/Application Support/Sublime Text/Packages/User/` :
   https://raw.githubusercontent.com/slint-ui/slint/master/editors/sublime/Slint.sublime-syntax
   https://raw.githubusercontent.com/slint-ui/slint/master/editors/sublime/Slint.tmPreferences
4. Download the LSP package settings file into your User Package folder:
   https://raw.githubusercontent.com/slint-ui/slint/master/editors/sublime/LSP.sublime-settings
5. Modify the slint-lsp command path in `LSP.sublime-settings` to point to the cargo installation path in your home folder (**Replace YOUR_USER by your username**):
   `"command": ["/home/YOUR_USER/.cargo/bin/slint-lsp"]`
6. Run "LSP: Enable Language Server Globally" or "LSP: Enable Language Server in Project" from Sublime's Command Palette to allow the server to start.
7. Open a .slint file - if the server starts its name will be in the left side of the status bar.

### Live Preview

In order to **preview a component**, when you have a .slint file open, place your cursor to
the name of the component you would like to preview and select the "Show preview" button that
will appear on the right of the editor pane.
