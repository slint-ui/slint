We provide extensions or configuration files for different editors to better support .slint files.

### Editors

- [Visual Studio Code](../vscode/)
- [Kate](../kate/)
- [Qt Creator](../qt-creator/)
- [Helix](../helix/)
- [(Neo-)Vim](../neo-vim/)
- [Sublime Text](../sublime-text/)
- [JetBrains IDE](../jetbrains/)
- [Zed](../zed)

If your favorite editor is not in the list of supported editors, it just means we did not test it, not that it doesn't work. We do provide a language server for Slint that should work with most editor that supports the Language Server Protocol (LSP). If you do test your editor with it, we would be happy to accept a pull request that adds instructions here.

## <a name="slint-lsp"/>Slint Language Server (`slint-lsp`)

Most modern editors use the [Language Server Protocol (LSP)](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/) to add support for different programming languages.
Slint provides an LSP implementation with the `slint-lsp` binary.

To install `slint-lsp`, either:

* [Download the binary](https://github.com/slint-ui/slint/releases/latest)
* Run `cargo install slint-lsp` if you have a Rust installation

Please refer to your editors documentation for details on how to set up language servers.

### Formatting Slint files

Slint files can be auto-formatted using `slint-lsp format <file-name>`.

By default, this will print the formatted file to the terminal.
Use `-i`/`--inline` to format the file on disk.

If you have slint-lsp configured in your editor, you should be able to format .slint files via your editor as well.

### Slint Live Preview

Slint's live preview feature lets you see your code changes in real-time.
This is a really powerful way to iterate quickly on your UI without having to recompile anything.

If you have slint-lsp configured in your editor, you can launch the live preview directly from your editor.

**Example in Neovim:**

### Running `slint-viewer` directly

To open the live preview from a terminal, you can use the `slint-viewer` binary.

To install it either:

* [Download the binary](https://github.com/slint-ui/slint/releases/latest)
* Run `cargo install slint-viewer` if you have a Rust installation

Then run `slint-viewer --auto-reload <path/to/file.slint>`.

**Example on the [Printer Demo](https://github.com/slint-ui/slint/blob/master/demos/printerdemo/ui/printerdemo.slint)**
