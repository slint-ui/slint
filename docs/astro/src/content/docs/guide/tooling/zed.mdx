[Zed](https://zed.dev) is a high-performance, multiplayer code editor. The [zed-slint extension](https://github.com/slint-ui/slint/tree/master/editors/zed), originally developed and donated by Luke Jones, now lives under the slint organization. It integrates the latest release of the [slint language server](../manual-setup/#slint-lsp) into Zed, offering code completion and syntax highlighting. Install the extension via the following steps:

1. Open the extensions tab via the Zed -> Extensions menu.
2. In the search field, enter "slint".
3. Click on "Install" for the "Slint" extension.
