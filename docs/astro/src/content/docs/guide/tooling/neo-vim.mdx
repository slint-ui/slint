## Vim

To install the Slint Language server, check the [LSP Documentation](../manual-setup/#slint-lsp).

Vim support the Language Server Protocol via its [Conquer of Completion](https://github.com/neoclide/coc.nvim)
plugin. Together with the Slint LSP server, this enables inline diagnostics and code completion when
editing `.slint` files.

After installing the extension, for example via [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug),
two additional configuration changes are needed to integrate the LSP server with vim:

1. Make vim recognize the `.slint` files with the correct file type

Install the [`slint-ui/vim-slint`](https://github.com/slint-ui/vim-slint) plugin.

Alternatively you can add the following to your vim configuration file (e.g. `vimrc`) to
enable automatic recognition of `.slint` files:

```
autocmd BufEnter *.slint :setlocal filetype=slint
```

2. Make sure the slint language server is installed and can be found in PATH.

3. Configure Conquer of Completion to use the Slint LSP server

Start `vim` and run the `:CocConfig` command to bring up the buffer that allows editing
the JSON configuration file (`coc-settings.json`), and make sure the following mapping
exists under the `language` server section:

```json
{
  "languageserver": {
    "slint": {
      "command": "slint-lsp",
      "filetypes": ["slint"]
    }
  }
}
```

## Neovim

Follow step 1. of the Vim section to get support for `.slint` files.

The easiest way to use the language server itself in Neovim is via the [`neovim/nvim-lspconfig`](https://github.com/neovim/nvim-lspconfig)
and [`williamboman/nvim-lsp-installer`](https://github.com/williamboman/nvim-lsp-installer) plugins. Once these are installed
you can run `:LspInstall slint_lsp` to install the lsp binary (on Windows, Linux, and macOS).

Once the slint_lsp language server is installed and running, you can trigger the live preview
via the code actions. Unfortunately there are several ways to trigger these, so please check your
configuration.

Also, if you use `nvim-treesitter` you can install the Tree Sitter parser for Slint using `TSInstall slint`
for syntax highlighting and indentation support.
