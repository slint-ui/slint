This tutorial showed you how to combine built-in Slint elements with C++, Rust, or NodeJS code to build a
game. There is much more to Slint, such as layouts, widgets, or styling.

We recommend the following links to continue:

-   [Examples](https://github.com/slint-ui/slint/tree/master/examples): The Slint repository has several demos and examples. These are a great starting point to learn how to use many Slint features.
    -   [Todo Example](https://github.com/slint-ui/slint/tree/master/examples/todo): This is one of the examples that implements a classic use-case.
    -   [Memory Puzzle](https://github.com/slint-ui/slint/tree/master/examples/memory): This is a slightly more polished version of the code in this example and you can <a href="https://slint.dev/demos/memory/" target="_blank">play the wasm version</a> in your browser.
