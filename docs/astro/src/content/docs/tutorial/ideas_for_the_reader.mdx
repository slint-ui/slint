import Link from '/src/components/Link.astro';

The game is visually bare. Here are some ideas on how you could make further changes to enhance it:

-   The tiles could have rounded corners, to look less sharp. Use the <Link type="BorderRadiusRectangle" label="border-radius" />
    property of <Link type="Rectangle" /> to achieve that.

-   In real-world memory games, the back of the tiles often have some common graphic. You could add an image with
    the help of another <Link type="Image" />
    element. Note that you may have to use _Rectangle_'s _clip property_
    element around it to ensure that the image is clipped away when the curtain effect opens.
