The `StyledText` type renders text with various styling and interactive properties, such as bolded, underlined and colored sections as well as HTTP links. It is based on a subset of the [commonmark](https://commonmark.org/) spec.

## Features

Styled Text supports the following features:

- Italics
- Strikethroughs
- Inline code
- Links
- Underlines via `<u>` tags
- Colors via `color="..."` attributes in `<font>` tags
- Ordered and unordered lists

### Currently Unsupported

- Headings
- Images
- Tables
- Block Quotes
- Subscripts
- Superscripts
- Horizontal rules
- Footnotes
- Math expressions
- HTML Tags outside of `<u>` and `<font>`



## Interpolation

Text can be interpolated into strings for styled text with the `@markdown` macro. For example, `@markdown("Hello *{}*", "World")` becomes `"Hello *World*"`.

Any text passed as an argument to the macro will be escaped, for example `@markdown("Hello {}", "*World*")` will become `"Hello \*World\*"`
