# Slint Build Guide

This page explains how to build and test Slint.

## Prerequisites

### Installing Rust

Install Rust by following the [Rust Getting Started Guide](https://www.rust-lang.org/learn/get-started). If you already
have Rust installed, make sure that it's at least version 1.66 or newer. You can check which version you have installed
by running `rustc --version`.

Once this is done, you should have the `rustc` compiler and the `cargo` build system installed in your path.

### Linux

For Linux a few additional packages beyond the usual build essentials are needed for development and running apps:

- xcb (`libxcb-shape0-dev` `libxcb-xfixes0-dev` on debian based distributions)
- xkbcommon (`libxkbcommon-dev` on debian based distributions)
- fontconfig library (`libfontconfig-dev` on debian based distributions)
- (optional) Qt will be used when `qmake` is found in `PATH`

`xcb` and `xcbcommon` aren't needed if you are only using `backend-winit-wayland` without `backend-winit-x11`.

### macOS

- Make sure the "Xcode Command Line Tools" are installed: `xcode-select --install`
- (optional) Qt will be used when `qmake` is found in `PATH`

### Windows

- Make sure the MSVC Build Tools are installed: `winget install Microsoft.VisualStudio.2022.BuildTools`
- (optional) make sure Qt is installed and `qmake` is in the `Path`

### C++ API (optional)

To use Slint from C++, the following extra dependencies are needed:

- **[cmake](https://cmake.org/download/)** (3.21 or newer)
- **[Ninja](https://ninja-build.org)** (Optional, or remove the `-GNinja` when invoking `cmake`)
- A C++ compiler that supports C++20 (e.g., **MSVC 2022 17.3** on Windows, or **GCC 10**)

### Node.js API (optional)

To use Slint from Node.js, the following extra dependencies are needed.

- **[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)** (including npm) At this time you will need to use the version 16.
- **[Python](https://www.python.org)**

### Symlinks in the repository (Windows)

The Slint repository makes use of symbolic links to avoid duplication.
On Windows, this require to set a git config before cloning, and have Windows
switched in developer mode or do the git clone as Administrator

```sh
git clone -c core.symlinks=true https://github.com/slint-ui/slint
```

More info: <https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/wiki/Symbolic-Links>

## Building and Testing

Most of the project is written in Rust, and compiling and running the test can
done with cargo.

```sh
cargo build
cargo test
```

**Important:** Note that `cargo test` does not work without first calling `cargo build` because the
the required dynamic library won't be found.

### C++ Tests

The C++ tests are contained in the `test-driver-cpp` crate. It requires the Slint C++ library to be built,
which isn't done by default. Build it explicitly before running the tests:

```sh
cargo build --lib -p slint-cpp
cargo test -p test-driver-cpp
```

### Node.js Tests

The Node.js tests are contained in the `test-driver-nodejs` crate. It requires the Slint node library to be built,
which isn't done by default. Build it explicitly before running the tests:

```sh
cargo build -p slint-node
cargo build -p test-driver-nodejs
```

### More Info About Tests

For more details about the tests and how they are implemented, see [testing.md](./testing.md).

## C++ API Build

The Slint C++ API is implemented as a normal cmake build:

```sh
mkdir cppbuild && cd cppbuild
cmake -GNinja ..
cmake --build .
```

The build will call cargo to build the Rust libraries, and build the examples.
To install the libraries and everything you need, use:

```sh
cmake --install .
```

You can pass `-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX` in the first cmake command in order to choose the installation location.

### Node.js API Build

The Slint Node.js API is implemented as npm build. You can build it locally using the following command line:

```sh
cd api/node
npm install
```

To build your own project against the Git version of the Slint Node.js API, add the path to the `api/node` folder
in the dependencies section of your `package.json`:

```json
    "dependencies": {
        "slint-ui": "/path/to/api/node"
    },
```

## Cross-Compiling

Slint can be cross-compiled to different target architectures and environments. For the Rust build we
have had a good experience using [`cross`](https://github.com/rust-embedded/cross). For convenience we're
including a `Cross.toml` configuration file for `cross` in the source tree along with Docker containers that
allow targeting a Debian ARMv7 and ARMv8 based Distribution with X11 or Wayland, out of the box. If you want to use the default Cross containers or your own, make sure the [dependencies](#Prerequisites) are in the container.

This includes for example the Raspberry Pi OS. Using the following steps you can run the examples on a
pi:

```sh
cross build --target armv7-unknown-linux-gnueabihf --workspace --exclude slint-node --release
scp target/armv7-unknown-linux-gnueabihf/release/printerdemo pi@raspberrypi.local:.
```

Finally on a shell on the Pi:

```sh
DISPLAY=:0 ./printerdemo
```

## Examples

See the [examples](/examples) folder for examples to build, run and test.

## Running the Viewer

Slint also includes a viewer tool that can load `.slint` files dynamically at run-time. It's a
cargo-integrated binary and can be run directly on the `.slint` files, for example:

```sh
cargo run --release --bin slint-viewer -- examples/printerdemo/ui/printerdemo.slint
```

## Generating the Documentation

### Rust

The documentation for the different crates is built using rustdoc.

The language documentation has snippets in the .slint language which can be previewed by injecting
html to the documentation with the `--html-in-header` rustdoc flag.

Use the following command line to build the documentation to include preview of the .slint files.

```sh
RUSTDOCFLAGS="--html-in-header=$PWD/docs/resources/slint-docs-preview.html --html-in-header=$PWD/docs/resources/slint-docs-highlight.html" cargo doc --no-deps --features slint/document-features,slint/log
```

The documentation will be located in the `target/doc` sub-folder.

### C++

The C++ documentation requires Python and doxygen to be installed on your system.

Run the following command to invoke doxygen and related tools and generate the documentation in the `target/cppdocs` sub-folder:

```sh
cargo xtask cppdocs
```
