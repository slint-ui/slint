# Slint Build Guide

This page explains how to build and test Slint.

## Prerequisites



### Installing Rust

Install Rust by following the [Rust Getting Started Guide](https://www.rust-lang.org/learn/get-started). If you already
have Rust installed, make sure that it's at least version 1.73 or newer. You can check which version you have installed
by running `rustc --version`.

Once this is done, you should have the `rustc` compiler and the `cargo` build system installed in your path.
### Dependencies
* **FFMPEG**

* **Skia** (only few available binaries): 
<center> 

| Platform                          | Binaries                                           |
| --------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| Windows                           | `x86_64-pc-windows-msvc`                           |
| Linux Ubuntu 16+<br />CentOS 7, 8 | `x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu`                         |
| macOS                             | `x86_64-apple-darwin`                              |
| Android                           | `aarch64-linux-android`<br/>`x86_64-linux-android` |
| iOS                               | `aarch64-apple-ios`<br/>`x86_64-apple-ios`         |
| WebAssembly                       | `wasm32-unknown-emscripten`                        |
  
</center> 

  - Use Skia capable toolchain `rustup default stable-x86_64-pc-windows-msvc`

### Linux

For Linux a few additional packages beyond the usual build essentials are needed for development and running apps:

- xcb (`libxcb-shape0-dev` `libxcb-xfixes0-dev` on debian based distributions)
- xkbcommon (`libxkbcommon-dev` on debian based distributions)
- fontconfig library (`libfontconfig-dev` on debian based distributions)
- (optional) Qt will be used when `qmake` is found in `PATH`
- FFMPEG library `clang` `libavcodec-dev` `libavformat-dev` `libavutil-dev` `libavfilter-dev` `libavdevice-dev` `libasound2-dev` `pkg-config`

`xcb` and `xcbcommon` aren't needed if you are only using `backend-winit-wayland` without `backend-winit-x11`.

### macOS

- Make sure the "Xcode Command Line Tools" are installed: `xcode-select --install`
- (optional) Qt will be used when `qmake` is found in `PATH`
- FFMPEG `brew install pkg-config ffmpeg`



### Windows
- See [System Link](#symlinks-in-the-repository-windows) 
- Make sure the MSVC Build Tools are installed: `winget install Microsoft.VisualStudio.2022.BuildTools`
- (optional) make sure Qt is installed and `qmake` is in the `Path`
- FFMPEG 
  -  Option 1:
      - install [vcpkg](https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg#quick-start-windows)
      - `vcpkg install ffmpeg --triplet x64-windows`
      - Make sure `VCPKG_ROOT` is set to where `vcpkg` is installed
      - Make sure `%VCPKG_ROOT%\installed\x64-windows\bin` is in your path 

    - Option 2: 
      - Download FFMPEG 4.4 shared and extract (https://github.com/BtbN/FFmpeg-Builds/releases/tag/latest) 
      - Add FFMPEG to path: `*\ffmpeg\bin` `*\ffmpeg\include\libavutil` `*\ffmpeg\lib`


### C++ API (optional)

To use Slint from C++, the following extra dependencies are needed:

- **[cmake](https://cmake.org/download/)** (3.21 or newer)
- **[Ninja](https://ninja-build.org)** (Optional, or remove the `-GNinja` when invoking `cmake`)
- A C++ compiler that supports C++20 (e.g., **MSVC 2022 17.3** on Windows, or **GCC 10**)

### Node.js API (optional)

To use Slint from Node.js, the following extra dependencies are needed.

- **[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)** (including npm) At this time you will need to use the version 16.
- **[Python](https://www.python.org)**

### Symlinks in the repository (Windows)

The Slint repository makes use of symbolic links to avoid duplication.
On Windows, this require to set a git config before cloning, and have Windows
switched in developer mode or do the git clone as Administrator

```sh
git clone -c core.symlinks=true https://github.com/slint-ui/slint
```

More info: <https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/wiki/Symbolic-Links>

## Building and Testing

Most of the project is written in Rust, and compiling and running the test can
done with cargo.

```sh
cargo build
cargo test
```

### Building workspace

<center> **  <strong> Not recommended</strong>  **    </center>


To build all examples install the entire workplace to executables 
(excluding [UEFI-demo](https://github.com/slint-ui/slint/tree/master/examples/uefi-demo) - different target)


 - Build workspace
    ```sh
        cargo build --workspace --exclude uefi-demo --release
    ```


**Important:** Note that `cargo test` does not work without first calling `cargo build` because the
the required dynamic library won't be found.

### C++ Tests

The C++ tests are contained in the `test-driver-cpp` crate. It requires the Slint C++ library to be built,
which isn't done by default. Build it explicitly before running the tests:

```sh
cargo build --lib -p slint-cpp
cargo test -p test-driver-cpp
```

### Node.js Tests

The Node.js tests are contained in the `test-driver-nodejs` crate. The node integration will be run
automatically when running the tests:

```sh
cargo build -p test-driver-nodejs
```

### More Info About Tests

For more details about the tests and how they are implemented, see [testing.md](./testing.md).



## C++ API Build

The Slint C++ API is implemented as a normal cmake build:

```sh
mkdir cppbuild && cd cppbuild
cmake -GNinja ..
cmake --build .
```

The build will call cargo to build the Rust libraries, and build the examples.
To install the libraries and everything you need, use:

```sh
cmake --install .
```

You can pass `-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX` in the first cmake command in order to choose the installation location.

### Node.js API Build

The Slint Node.js API is implemented as npm build. You can build it locally using the following command line:

```sh
cd api/node
npm install
```

To build your own project against the Git version of the Slint Node.js API, add the path to the `api/node` folder
in the dependencies section of your `package.json`:

```json
    "dependencies": {
        "slint-ui": "/path/to/api/node"
    },
```

## Cross-Compiling

Slint can be cross-compiled to different target architectures and environments. For the Rust build we
have had a good experience using [`cross`](https://github.com/rust-embedded/cross). For convenience we're
including a `Cross.toml` configuration file for `cross` in the source tree along with Docker containers that
allow targeting a Debian ARMv7 and ARMv8 based Distribution with X11 or Wayland, out of the box. If you want to use the default Cross containers or your own, make sure the [dependencies](#Prerequisites) are in the container.

This includes for example the Raspberry Pi OS. Using the following steps you can run the examples on a
pi:

```sh
cross build --target armv7-unknown-linux-gnueabihf --workspace --exclude slint-node --exclude pyslint --release
scp target/armv7-unknown-linux-gnueabihf/release/printerdemo pi@raspberrypi.local:.
```

Finally on a shell on the Pi:

```sh
DISPLAY=:0 ./printerdemo
```

## Examples

See the [examples](/examples) folder for examples to build, run and test.

## Running the Viewer

Slint also includes a viewer tool that can load `.slint` files dynamically at run-time. It's a
cargo-integrated binary and can be run directly on the `.slint` files, for example:

```sh
cargo run --release --bin slint-viewer -- examples/printerdemo/ui/printerdemo.slint
```

## Generating the Documentation

The Slint documentation consists of five parts:

- The tutorials
- The Rust API documentation
- The C++ API documentation
- The Node.js API documentation
- The DSL documentation

### Tutorials

There are three tutorials built with mdbook, one for each of the three languages supported by Slint.

**Prerequisites**:

- [mdbook](https://rust-lang.github.io/mdBook/guide/installation.html)

#### Rust tutorial

```shell
mdbook build docs/quickstart/rust
```

#### C++ tutorial

```shell
mdbook build docs/quickstart/cpp
```

#### NodeJS tutorial

```shell
mdbook build docs/quickstart/node
```

### Slint DSL docs

**Prerequisites**:

- [pipenv](https://pipenv.pypa.io/en/latest/)
- [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

Use the following command line to build the documentation for the Slint DSL using `rustdoc` to the `target/slintdocs/html` folder:

```shell
cargo xtask slintdocs --show-warnings
```


### Rust API docs

Run the following command to generate the documentation using rustdoc in the `target/doc/` sub-folder:

```sh
RUSTDOCFLAGS="--html-in-header=$PWD/docs/resources/slint-docs-preview.html --html-in-header=$PWD/docs/resources/slint-docs-highlight.html" cargo doc --no-deps --features slint/document-features,slint/log
```

 Note: `--html-in-header` arguments passed to rustdoc via `RUSTDOCFLAGS` are used to enable syntax highlighting and live-preview for Slint example snippets.
### C++ API docs

**Prerequisites**:

- [Doxygen](https://www.doxygen.nl/download.html)

Run the following command to generate the documentation using sphinx/exhale/breathe/doxygen/myst_parser in the `target/cppdocs` sub-folder:

```sh
cargo xtask cppdocs
```

### Node.js API docs

Run the following commands from the `/api/node` sub-folder to generate the docs using [typedoc](https://typedoc.org/) in the `/api/node/docs` sub-folder:

```sh
npm install
npm run docs
```
