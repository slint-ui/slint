Use `TouchArea` to control what happens when the region it covers is touched or interacted with
using the mouse.

When not part of a layout, its width or height default to 100% of the parent element.

### `has-hover`
<SlintProperty propName="has-hover" typeName="bool" PropertyVisibility="out">
Set to true when the mouse is over the `TouchArea` area.
</SlintProperty>

### `mouse-cursor`
<SlintProperty propName="mouse-cursor" typeName="enum" enumName="MouseCursor">
The mouse cursor type when the mouse is hovering the `TouchArea`.
</SlintProperty>

### `mouse-x`
<SlintProperty propName="mouse-x" typeName="length" PropertyVisibility="out">
Set by the `TouchArea` to the position of the mouse within it.
</SlintProperty>

### `mouse-y`
<SlintProperty propName="mouse-y" typeName="length" PropertyVisibility="out">
Set by the `TouchArea` to the position of the mouse within it.
</SlintProperty>

### `pressed-x`
<SlintProperty propName="pressed-x" typeName="length" PropertyVisibility="out">
Set by the `TouchArea` to the position of the mouse at the moment it was last pressed.
</SlintProperty>

### `pressed-y`
<SlintProperty propName="pressed-y" typeName="length" PropertyVisibility="out">
Set by the `TouchArea` to the position of the mouse at the moment it was last pressed.
</SlintProperty>

</SlintProperty>


### Callbacks

### `clicked()`
Invoked when clicked: A finger or the left mouse button is pressed, then released on this element.

### `double-clicked()`
Invoked when double-clicked. The left mouse button is pressed and released twice on this element in a short
period of time, or the same is done with a finger. The `clicked()` callbacks will be triggered before the `double-clicked()` callback is triggered.

### `moved()`
The mouse or finger has been moved. This will only be called if the mouse is also pressed or the finger continues to touch
the display. See also **pointer-event(PointerEvent)**.

### `pointer-event(PointerEvent)`
Invoked when a button was pressed or released, a finger touched, or the pointer moved.
The [_`PointerEvent`_](language/builtins/structs.md#pointerevent) argument contains information such which button was pressed
and any active keyboard modifiers.
In the [_`PointerEventKind::Move`_](../language/builtins/structs.md#pointereventkind) case the `buttons` field will always
be set to `PointerEventButton::Other`, independent of whether any button is pressed or not.

### `scroll-event(PointerScrollEvent) -> EventResult`
Invoked when the mouse wheel was rotated or another scroll gesture was made.
The [_`PointerScrollEvent`_](../language/builtins/structs.md#pointerscrollevent) argument contains information about how much to scroll in what direction.
The returned [`EventResult`](../language/builtins/enums.md#eventresult) indicates whether to accept or ignore the event. Ignored events are
forwarded to the parent element.
