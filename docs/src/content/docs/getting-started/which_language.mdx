title: Use your preferred language
description: Business logic in Slint.
---

The Slint UI is universal to all platforms. But you can use your preferred language to write your business logic.

## Rust
If you are a Rust developer, you can use Rust to write your business logic. Rust is a compiled language that is fast and safe.

## C++
If you are a C++ developer, you can use C++ to write your business logic.

## JavaScript
If you are a JavaScript developer, you can use JavaScript to write your business logic. We recommend using TypeScript as it better maps
with the static typing of the Slint UI language. The code ends up running on runtime (not the browser) and Slint currently supports NodeJS, Deno and Bun.

## Python (beta)
If you are a Python developer, you can use Python to write your business logic. We are currently working on a Python version of Slint and if you want to experiment with the beta version follow the link.
