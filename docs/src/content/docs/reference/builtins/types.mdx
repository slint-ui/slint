All properties in Slint have a type. Slint knows these basic types:

| Name  | description  | Default value |
| -------------------------- | -------------------------------------- | ------------- | 
| `angle`   | Angle measurement, corresponds to a literal like `90deg`, `1.2rad`, `0 25turn`    | `0deg`        |
| `bool`    | boolean whose value can be either `true` or `false`.                              | `false`       |                                                                                                                                          
| `brush`   | A brush is a special type that can be either initialized from a `color` or a `gradient`. See <Link type="ColorsRef" label="Colors & Brushes" />.   | `transparent` |
| `color`   | RGB color with an alpha channel, with 8 bit precision for each channel. CSS color names as well as the hexadecimal color encodings are supported, such as #RRGGBBAA or #RGB. See <Link type="ColorsRef" label="Colors & Brushes" />.   | `transparent` |
| `duration` | Type for the duration of animations. A suffix like `ms` (millisecond) or `s` (second) is used to indicate the precision.  | `0ms` |                                                                                                                                                                                  
| `easing`             | Property animation allow specifying an easing curve. See <Link type="AnimationRef" label="animations"/> for list of values.      | `linear` |                                                                                                                                                                                 
| `float`              | Signed, 32-bit floating point number. Numbers with a `%` suffix are automatically divided by 100, so for example `30%` is the same as `0.30`.  | `0` |                                                                                                                                                     
| `image`              | A reference to an image, can be initialized with the `@image-url("...")` construct  | empty image |                                                                                                                                                                                                         
| `int`                | Signed integral number.                                                | `0` |                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
| `length`             | The type used for `x`, `y`, `width` and `height` coordinates. Corresponds to a literal like `1px`, `1pt`, `1in`, `1mm`, or `1cm`. It can be converted to and from length provided the binding is run in a context where there is an access to the device pixel ratio. | `0px` | 
| `percent`            | Signed, 32-bit floating point number that is interpreted as percentage. Literal number assigned to properties of this type must have a `%` suffix.    | `0%` | 
| `physical-length`    | This is an amount of physical pixels. To convert from an integer to a length unit, one can simply multiply by `1px`. Or to convert from a length to a float, one can divide by `1phx`.   | `0phx` |                                                                                         
| `relative-font-size` | Relative font size factor that is multiplied with the `Window.default-font-size` and can be converted to a `length`.  | 0rem |                                                                                                                                                         
| `string`             | UTF-8 encoded, reference counted string.                               | `""`          | 

Please see the language specific API references how these types are mapped to the APIs of the different programming languages.

## Images

The `image` type is a reference to an image. It's defined using the `@image-url("...")` construct.
The address within the `@image-url` function must be known at compile time.

Slint looks for images in the following places:

1. The absolute path or the path relative to the current `.slint` file.
2. The include path used by the compiler to look up `.slint` files.

Access an `image`'s dimension using its `width` and `height` properties.

```slint
export component Example inherits Window {
    preferred-width: 150px;
    preferred-height: 50px;

    in property <image> some_image: @image-url("https://slint.dev/logo/slint-logo-full-light.svg");

    Text {
        text: "The image is " + some_image.width + "x" + some_image.height;
    }
}
```

It is also possible to load images supporting [9 slice scaling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/9-slice_scaling) (also called nine patch or border images)
by adding a  `nine-slice(...)` argument. The argument can have either one, two, or four numbers that specifies the size of the edges.
The numbers are either `top right bottom left` or `vertical horizontal`, or one number for everything

## String

Any sequence of utf-8 encoded characters surrounded by quotes is a `string`: `"foo"`.

Escape sequences may be embedded into strings to insert characters that would
be hard to insert otherwise:

| Escape          | Result                                                                                          |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `\"`            | `"`                                                                                             |
| `\\`            | `\`                                                                                             |
| `\n`            | new line                                                                                        |
| `\u{x}`         | where `x` is a hexadecimal number, expands to the unicode code point represented by this number |
| `\{expression}` | the result of evaluating the expression                                                         |

Anything else following an unescaped `\` is an error.

```slint
export component Example inherits Text {
    text: "hello";
}
```

:::note[Note]
  The `\{...}` syntax is not valid within the `slint!` macro in Rust.

## Structs

Define named structures using the `struct` keyword:

```slint
export struct Player  {
    name: string,
    score: int,
}

export component Example {
    in-out property<Player> player: { name: "Foo", score: 100 };
}
```

The default value of a struct, is initialized with all its fields set to their default value.

### Anonymous Structures

Declare anonymous structures using `{ identifier1: type1, identifier2: type2 }`
syntax, and initialize them using
`{ identifier1: expression1, identifier2: expression2  }`.

You may have a trailing `,` after the last expression or type.

```slint
export component Example {
    in-out property<{name: string, score: int}> player: { name: "Foo", score: 100 };
    in-out property<{a: int, }> foo: { a: 3 };
}
```

## Enums

Define an enumeration with the `enum` keyword:

```slint
export enum CardSuit { clubs, diamonds, hearts, spade }

export component Example {
    in-out property<CardSuit> card: spade;
    out property<bool> is-clubs: card == CardSuit.clubs;
}
```

Enum values can be referenced by using the name of the enum and the name of the value
separated by a dot. (eg: `CardSuit.spade`)

The name of the enum can be omitted in bindings of the type of that enum, or if the
return value of a callback is of that enum.

The default value of each enum type is always the first value.

## Arrays and Models

Arrays are declared by wrapping `[` and `]` square brackets around the type of the array elements.

Array literals as well as properties holding arrays act as models in `for` expressions.

```slint
export component Example {
    in-out property<[int]> list-of-int: [1,2,3];
    in-out property<[{a: int, b: string}]> list-of-structs: [{ a: 1, b: "hello" }, {a: 2, b: "world"}];
}
```

Arrays define the following operations:

-   **`array.length`**: One can query the length of an array and model using the builtin `.length` property.
-   **`array[index]`**: The index operator retrieves individual elements of an array.

Out of bound access into an array will return default-constructed values.

```slint
export component Example {
    in-out property<[int]> list-of-int: [1,2,3];

    out property <int> list-len: list-of-int.length;
    out property <int> first-int: list-of-int[0];
}
```
