import CodeSnippetMD from '../../../components/CodeSnippetMD.astro';

The Slint elements have many common properties, callbacks and behavior. 
This page describes these properties and their usage.

## `init()`

Every element implicitly declares an `init` callback. You can assign a code block to it that will be invoked when the
element is instantiated and after all properties are initialized with the value of their final binding. The order of
invocation is from inside to outside. The following example will print "first", then "second", and then "third":

```slint
component MyButton inherits Rectangle {
    in-out property <string> text: "Initial";
    init => {
        // If `text` is queried here, it will have the value "Hello".
        debug("first");
    }
}

component MyCheckBox inherits Rectangle {
    init => { debug("second"); }
}

export component MyWindow inherits Window {
    MyButton {
        text: "Hello";
        init => { debug("third"); }
    }
    MyCheckBox {
    }
}
```

Don't use this callback to initialize properties, because this violates the declarative principle.

Even though the `init` callback exists on all components, it cannot be set from application code,
i.e. an `on_init` function does not exist in the generated code. This is because the callback is invoked during the creation of the component, before you could call `on_init` to actually set it.

While the `init` callback can invoke other callbacks, e.g. one defined in a `global` section, and
you _can_ bind these in the backend, this doesn't work for statically-created components, including
the window itself, because you need an instance to set the globals binding. But it is possible
to use this for dynamically created components (for example ones behind an `if`):

```slint
export global SystemService  {
    // This callback can be implemented in native code using the Slint API
    callback ensure_service_running();
}

component MySystemButton inherits Rectangle {
    init => {
        SystemService.ensure_service_running();
    }
    // ...
}

export component AppWindow inherits Window {
    in property <bool> show-button: false;

    // MySystemButton isn't initialized at first, only when show-button is set to true.
    // At that point, its init callback will call ensure_service_running()
    if show-button : MySystemButton {}
}
```


## Geometry

These properties are valid on all **visible** items:

### x
<SlintProperty propName="x" typeName="length" > 
The position of the element relative to its parent.
</SlintProperty>

### y
<SlintProperty propName="y" typeName="length" > 
The position of the element relative to its parent.
</SlintProperty>

### z
<SlintProperty propName="z" typeName="float" > 
Allows to specify a different order to stack the items with its siblings.
The value must be a compile time constant.

:::caution[Caution]
Currently the `z` value is a compile time constant and cannot be changed at runtime.
:::

</SlintProperty>

### absolute-position
<SlintProperty propName="absolute-position" typeName="struct" structName="Point" > 
The position of the element within the contained window.

</SlintProperty>

### width
<SlintProperty propName="width" typeName="length" > 
The width of the element. When set, this overrides the default width.
</SlintProperty>

### height
<SlintProperty propName="height" typeName="length" > 
The height of the element. When set, this overrides the default height.
</SlintProperty>

### opacity
<SlintProperty propName="opacity" typeName="float" defaultValue="1">
A value between 0 and 1 (or a percentage) that is used to draw
the element and its children with transparency.
0 is fully transparent (invisible), and 1 is fully opaque.
The opacity is applied to the tree of child elements as if they
were first drawn into an intermediate layer, and then the whole layer is rendered with this opacity.

:::caution[Caution]
When an element has 0 opacity it will still take up layout space and any gesture handling will continue
to work. If the intent is to hide an element so it has no gesture handling or takes up layout space, 
use the `visible` property instead.
:::
</SlintProperty>

### visible
<SlintProperty propName="visible" typeName="bool" defaultValue="true">
When set to `false`, the element and all his children won't be drawn and not react to mouse input.

The following example demonstrates the `opacity` property with children. An opacity is applied to the red rectangle. Since the green rectangle is a child of the red one, you can see the gradient underneath it, but you can't see the red rectangle through the green one.
<CodeSnippetMD imagePath="/src/assets/generated/rectangle-opacity.png"  imageWidth="200" imageHeight="200"  imageAlt='rectangle opacity'>
```slint
Rectangle {
    x: 10px;
    y: 10px;
    width: 180px;
    height: 180px;
    background: #315afd;
    opacity: 0.5;
}

Rectangle {
    x: 10px;
    y: 210px;
    width: 180px;
    height: 180px;
    background: green;
    opacity: 0.5;
}
```
</CodeSnippetMD>
</SlintProperty>


### Layout

These properties are valid on all visible items and can be used to specify constraints when used in layouts:

-   **`col`**, **`row`**, **`colspan`**, **`rowspan`** (_in_ _int_): See [`GridLayout`](/master/docs/slint/reference/layouts/gridlayout).
-   **`horizontal-stretch`** and **`vertical-stretch`** (_in-out_ _float_): Specify how much relative space these elements are stretching in a layout. When 0, this means that the elements won't be stretched unless all elements are 0. Builtin widgets have a value of either 0 or 1.
-   **`max-width`** and **`max-height`** (_in_ _length_): The maximum size of an element
-   **`min-width`** and **`min-height`** (_in_ _length_): The minimum size of an element
-   **`preferred-width`** and **`preferred-height`** (_in_ _length_): The preferred size of an element

### Miscellaneous

-   **`cache-rendering-hint`** (_in_ _bool_): When set to `true`, this provides a hint to the renderer to cache the contents of the element and all the children into an intermediate cached layer. For complex sub-trees that rarely change this may speed up the rendering, at the expense of increased memory consumption. Not all rendering backends support this, so this is merely a hint. (default value: `false`)


-   **`dialog-button-role`** (_in_ _enum [`DialogButtonRole`](enums.md#dialogbuttonrole)_): Specify that this is a button in a `Dialog`.




## Accessibility

Use the following `accessible-` properties to make your items interact well with software like screen readers, braille terminals and other software to make your application accessible.
`accessible-role` must be set in order to be able to set any other accessible property or callback.

-   **`accessible-role`** (_in_ _enum [`AccessibleRole`](enums.md#accessiblerole)_): The role of the element. This property is mandatory to be able to use any other accessible properties. It should be set to a constant value. (default value: `none` for most elements, but `text` for the Text element)
-   **`accessible-checkable`** (_in_ _bool_): Whether the element is can be checked or not.
-   **`accessible-checked`** (_in_ _bool_): Whether the element is checked or not. This maps to the "checked" state of checkboxes, radio buttons, and other widgets.
-   **`accessible-description`** (_in_ _string_): The description for the current element.
-   **`accessible-enabled`** (_in_ _bool_): Whether the element is enabled or not. This maps to the "enabled" state of most widgets. (default value: `true`)
-   **`accessible-label`** (_in_ _string_): The label for an interactive element. (default value: empty for most elements, or the value of the `text` property for Text elements)
-   **`accessible-value-maximum`** (_in_ _float_): The maximum value of the item. This is used for example by spin boxes.
-   **`accessible-value-minimum`** (_in_ _float_): The minimum value of the item.
-   **`accessible-value-step`** (_in_ _float_) The smallest increment or decrement by which the current value can change. This corresponds to the step by which a handle on a slider can be dragged.
-   **`accessible-value`** (_in_ _string_): The current value of the item.
-   **`accessible-placeholder-text`** (_in_ _string_): A placeholder text to use when the item's value is empty. Applies to text elements.
-   **`accessible-selectable`** (_in_ _bool_): Whether the element can be selected or not.
-   **`accessible-selected`** (_in_ _bool_): Whether the element is selected or not. This maps to the "is-selected" state of listview items.
-   **`accessible-position-in-set`** (_in_ _int_): The index (starting from 0) of this element in a group of similar elements. Applies to list items, radio buttons and other elements.
-   **`accessible-size-of-set`** (_in_ _int_): The total number of elements in a group. Applies to all elements of a group like list items, radio buttons and other elements, but not to their parent container like list views, radio button groups or other grouping elements.

You can also use the following callbacks that are going to be called by the accessibility framework:

-  **`accessible-action-default()`**: Invoked when the default action for this widget is requested (eg: pressed for a button).
-  **`accessible-action-set-value(string)`**: Invoked when the user wants to change the accessible value.
-  **`accessible-action-increment()`**: Invoked when the user requests to increment the value.
-  **`accessible-action-decrement()`**: Invoked when the user requests to decrement the value.
