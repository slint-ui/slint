Use `TouchArea` to control what happens when the region it covers is touched or interacted with
using the mouse.

When not part of a layout, its width or height default to 100% of the parent element.

## Properties

### Callbacks

### clicked()
Invoked when clicked: A finger or the left mouse button is pressed, then released on this element.

### double-clicked()
Invoked when double-clicked. The left mouse button is pressed and released twice on this element in a short
period of time, or the same is done with a finger. The `clicked()` callbacks will be triggered before the `double-clicked()` callback is triggered.

### moved()
The mouse or finger has been moved. This will only be called if the mouse is also pressed or the finger continues to touch
the display. See also **pointer-event(PointerEvent)**.

### pointer-event(PointerEvent)
<PointerEvent />


### scroll-event(PointerScrollEvent) -> EventResult
Invoked when the mouse wheel was rotated or another scroll gesture was made.
The `PointerScrollEvent` argument contains information about how much to scroll in what direction.
<PointerScrollEvent />
The returned `EventResult`indicates whether to accept or ignore the event. Ignored events are
forwarded to the parent element.
<EventResult />
