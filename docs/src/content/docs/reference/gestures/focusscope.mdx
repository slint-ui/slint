The `FocusScope` exposes callbacks to intercept key events. Note that `FocusScope`
will only invoke them when it `has-focus`.

The [`KeyEvent`](structs.md#keyevent) has a text property, which is a character of the key entered.
When a non-printable key is pressed, the character will be either a control character,
or it will be mapped to a private unicode character. The mapping of these non-printable, special characters is available in the [`Key`](namespaces.md#key) namespace

## Properties

### has-focus
<SlintProperty propName="has-focus" typeName="bool" defaultValue="false" propertyVisibility="out">
Is `true` when the element has keyboard focus.
</SlintProperty>

### enabled
<SlintProperty propName="enabled" typeName="bool" defaultValue="true">
 When true, the `FocusScope` will make itself the focused element when clicked. Set this to false if you don't want the click-to-focus
    behavior. Similarly, a disabled `FocusScope` does not accept the focus via tab focus traversal. A parent `FocusScope` will still receive key events from
    child `FocusScope`s that were rejected, even if `enabled` is set to false.
</SlintProperty>

## Functions

### focus()
Call this function to transfer keyboard focus to this `FocusScope`, to receive future [`KeyEvent`](structs.md#keyevent)s.  

### clear-focus()
Call this function to remove keyboard focus from this `FocusScope` if it currently has the focus. See also [](../concepts/focus.md).

## Callbacks

### key-pressed(KeyEvent) -> EventResult
Invoked when a key is pressed, the argument is a [`KeyEvent`](structs.md#keyevent) struct. The returned [`EventResult`](enums.md#eventresult) 
indicates whether to accept or ignore the event. Ignored events are forwarded to the parent element.

### key-released(KeyEvent) -> EventResult
Invoked when a key is released, the argument is a [`KeyEvent`](structs.md#keyevent) struct. The returned [`EventResult`](enums.md#eventresult) 
indicates whether to accept or ignore the event. Ignored events are forwarded to the parent element.

### focus-changed-event()
Invoked when the focus on the `FocusScope` has changed.
