Slint provides a rich declarative UI language that will allows the expression of any type of user interface. 

Hide tedious complexity, avoid boilerplate, provide a 'component' abstraction that maps the way people think about UI's (text, images, buttons, dialogs, etc) and give upfront error handling.

It's also been designed to easy to learn and enable rapid iteration. It does this through enabling tooling such as a live-coding experience where you can see changes as quickly as you can type them. As well as allow for rapid prototyping where the same UI can be evolved from an initial concept, to a final shipped commercial product.

The final aim is to let developers and designers focus on what's important, adding value to their own product. Slint make common tasks easier. Adding custom fonts, using SVG images, and even details such as finding out the width and height of a source image require zero configuration or any specialist knowledge.
