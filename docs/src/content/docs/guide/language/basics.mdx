This guide will cover the fundamentals of the Slint Language. It's a simple language
that is easy to learn and use. It's also a language that is very powerful and can be used to create
any type of UI.

The first part covers the basic syntax

```slint
Text {
    text: "Hello World";
    color: blue;
}
```

Here we declared a `Text` element with a `text` property and a `color` property.
<CodeSnippetMD imagePath="/src/assets/generated/basic-syntax.png" scale="2"  imageWidth="100" imageHeight="100" imageAlt='Basic syntax'>
```slint playground
import { Button } from "std-widgets.slint";

component MyComponent inherits Window {
    width: 100px; height: 100px;
    background: transparent;
    Button {
        text: "Click me!";
    }
}
```
</CodeSnippetMD>

Here we reused the `Button` component from the standard widget library and gave it a custom label.

The next part covers the basic primitives the Slint language provides for drawing rectangles,
images and text. There are a lot more than those, but once you understand how to use these you
already understand the majority of how all components are built.

The next part will cover how to layout elements and nest them. Which is as simple as:

<CodeSnippetMD skip="true"  imagePath="/src/assets/generated/basic-layout.png" scale="3"  imageWidth="100" imageHeight="100" imageAlt='Basic syntax'>
```slint
import { Button } from "std-widgets.slint";
export component MyComponent inherits Window {
    background: transparent;
    VerticalLayout {
        padding: 10px;
        Text {
            text: "Top";
        }
        Text {
            text: "Middle";
        }
        Text {
            text: "Bottom";
        }
    }
}
```
</CodeSnippetMD>

<CodeSnippetMD noScreenShot needsBackground="true" imagePath="/src/assets/generated/basic-layout.png" scale="3"  imageWidth="200" imageHeight="200" imageAlt='Basic syntax'>
```slint
VerticalLayout {
    padding: 10px;
    Text {
        text: "Top";
    }
    Text {
        text: "Middle";
    }
    Text {
        text: "Bottom";
    }
}
```
</CodeSnippetMD>



The next part covers bindings.

The next part covers states.

The next part covers animations.



The next part covers the basics of the Slint language. It covers the basics of how to declare
elements and components, how to declare identifiers and how to use them.

```slint
component MyApp {
    Text {
        text: "Hello World";
        font-size: 24px;
    }
}
```

The final part covers how the Slint UI and the business logic communicate with each other.
