Amazing reactivity.

## Bindings

The binding expression is automatically re-evaluated when properties accessed in the expression change.

In the following example, the text of the button automatically changes when
the user presses the button. Incrementing the `counter` property automatically
invalidates the expression bound to `text` and triggers a re-evaluation.

```slint
import { Button } from "std-widgets.slint";
export component Example inherits Window {
    preferred-width: 50px;
    preferred-height: 50px;
    Button {
        property <int> counter: 3;
        clicked => { self.counter += 3 }
        text: self.counter * 2;
    }
}
```

The re-evaluation happens lazily when the property is queried.

Internally, a dependency is registered for any property accessed while evaluating a binding.
When a property changes, the dependencies are notified and all dependent bindings
are marked as dirty.

Callbacks in native code by default don't depend on any properties unless they query a property in the native code.

## Two-way Bindings

Create two-way bindings between properties with the `<=>` syntax. These properties will be linked
together and always contain the same value.

The right hand side of the `<=>` must be a reference to a property of the same type.
The property type is optional with two-way bindings, it will be inferred if not specified.
The initial value of a linked property will be the value of the right hand side of the binding.
The two linked properties must be compatible in terms of input/output.

```slint
export component Example  {
    in property<brush> rect-color <=> r.background;
    // It's allowed to omit the type to have it automatically inferred
    in property rect-color2 <=> r.background;
    r:= Rectangle {
        width: parent.width;
        height: parent.height;
        background: blue;
    }
}
```
