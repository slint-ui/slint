description: Embedded Platforms on which Slint has been tested
---

Slint runs on many embedded platforms.

The platform descriptions below cover what has been tested for deployment. For the development environment,
we recommend using a recent desktop operating system and compiler version.

## Embedded Linux

Slint runs on a variety of embedded Linux platforms. Generally speaking, Slint requires a modern Linux userspace
with working OpenGL ES 2.0 (or newer) or Vulkan drivers. We've had success running Slint on

-   Yocto based distributions. For C++ applications see [meta-slint](https://github.com/slint-ui/meta-slint) for recipes. Rust application work out of the box with Yocto's rust support.
-   BuildRoot based distributions.
-   [TorizonCore](https://www.torizon.io/torizoncore-os).

## Microcontrollers

Slint's platform abstraction allows for integration into any Rust or C++ based Microcontroller development
environment. Developers need to implement functionality to feed input events such as touch or keyboard, as
well as displaying the pixels rendered by Slint into a frame- or linebuffer.

## What about other platforms?
[Contact us](https://slint.dev/contact) if you need to support specific or older versions.
