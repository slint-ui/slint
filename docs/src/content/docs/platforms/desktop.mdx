description: Desktop platforms on which Slint has been tested
---

Generally, Slint runs on Windows, macOS, and popular Linux distributions. The following tables
cover versions that we specifically test. The general objective is to support the operating systems that
are supported by their vendors at the time of a Slint version release.

## Windows

| Operating System | Architecture |
| ---------------- | ------------ |
| Windows 10       | x86-64       |
| Windows 11       | x86-64       |

## macOS

| Operating System  | Architecture    |
| ----------------- | --------------- |
| macOS 12 Monterey | x86-64, aarch64 |
| macOS 13 Ventura  | x86-64, aarch64 |
| macOS 14 Sonoma   | x86-64, aarch64 |
| macOS 15 Sequoia  | x86-64, aarch64 |

## Linux

Linux desktop distribution present a diverse landscape, and Slint should run on any of them, provided that they
are using Wayland or X-Windows, glibc, and d-bus. If a Linux distribution provides Long Term Support (LTS),
Slint should run on the most recent LTS or newer, at the time of a Slint version release.

## What about other platforms?
[Contact us](https://slint.dev/contact) if you need to support specific or older versions.
