# Creating The Tiles From Code

This step places the game tiles randomly.

:::::{tab-set}
::::{tab-item} C++
:sync: cpp

Change the `main` function and includes in `src/main.cpp` to the following:

:::{literalinclude} main_tiles_from_cpp.cpp
:lines: 10-28
:::

The code takes the list of tiles, duplicates it, and shuffles it, accessing the `memory_tiles` property through the C++ code.

For each top-level property, Slint generates a getter and a setter function. In this case `get_memory_tiles` and `set_memory_tiles`.
Since `memory_tiles` is a Slint array, it's represented as a [`std::shared_ptr<slint::Model>`](https://slint.dev/docs/cpp/api/classslint_1_1model).

You can't change the model generated by Slint, but you can extract the tiles from it and put them
in a [`slint::VectorModel`](https://slint.dev/docs/cpp/api/classslint_1_1vectormodel) which inherits from `Model`.
`VectorModel` lets you make changes and you can use it to replace the static generated model.

::::

::::{tab-item} NodeJS
:sync: nodejs

Change `main.js` to the following:

:::{literalinclude} main_tiles_from_js.js
:lines: 6-23
:::

The code takes the list of tiles, duplicates it, and shuffles it, accessing the `memory_tiles` property through the JavaScript code.

As `memory_tiles` is an array, it's represented as a JavaScript [`Array`](https://slint.dev/docs/node/).
You can't change the model generated by Slint, but you can extract the tiles from it and put them
in a [`slint.ArrayModel`](https://slint.dev/docs/node/classes/arraymodel.html) which implements the [`Model`](https://slint.dev/docs/node/interfaces/model.html) interface.
`ArrayModel` allows you to make changes and you can use it to replace the static generated model.
::::

::::{tab-item} Rust
:sync: rust
:selected: true

The code uses the `rand` dependency for the randomization. Add it to the `Cargo.toml` file using the `cargo` command.

```sh
cargo add rand@0.8
```

Change the main function to the following:

:::{literalinclude} main_tiles_from_rust.rs
:lines: 6-26
:::

The code takes the list of tiles, duplicates it, and shuffles it, accessing the `memory_tiles` property through the Rust code.

For each top-level property,
Slint generates a getter and a setter function. In this case `get_memory_tiles` and `set_memory_tiles`.
Since `memory_tiles` is a Slint array represented as a [`Rc<dyn slint::Model>`](https://slint.dev/docs/rust/slint/trait.Model).

You can't change the model generated by Slint, but you can extract the tiles from it and put them
in a [`VecModel`](https://slint.dev/docs/rust/slint/struct.VecModel) which implements the `Model` trait.
`VecModel` lets you make changes and you can use it to replace the static generated model.

Running this code opens a window that now shows a 4 by 4 grid of rectangles, which show or hide
the icons when a player clicks on them.

There's one last aspect missing now, the rules for the game.
