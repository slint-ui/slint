Getting Started
===============

To use `Slint <https://slint.dev>`_ you need to embed your slint files in a project written
in a supported programming language, like C++, Rust, or JavaScript.

There are three different pathways to get started with Slint:

1. `SlintPad <https://slint.dev/editor>`_ - Use this to get a feel of the Slint language.
   This is a web browser-based tool where you can try Slint out.

2. As a UI Designer, working with Slint files locally, we recommend the following combination of software tools:

   - `Visual Studio Code <https://code.visualstudio.com>`_
   - `The Slint for Visual Studio Code Extension <https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Slint.slint>`_

3. As a Software Developer, integrating Slint into a new or existing code base, choose one of these languages to
   get started:

   - `C++ <https://slint.dev/docs/cpp/>`_
   - `Rust <https://slint.dev/docs/rust/slint/>`_
   - `JavaScript <https://slint.dev/docs/node/>`_
