A `FullscreenDialog` is a modal dialog that occupies the entire screen, typically used for complex forms or detailed content that requires more space than a standard dialog. It includes a header with a close button, title, and action buttons.

## Properties

### actions

An array of text labels for action buttons displayed in the header. These buttons appear on the right side of the header.
</SlintProperty>

### has-focus
<SlintProperty propName="has-focus" typeName="bool">
Whether the dialog has focus.
</SlintProperty>

### title
<SlintProperty propName="title" typeName="string">
The title text displayed in the header of the fullscreen dialog.
</SlintProperty>

## Callbacks
