# Carousel Demo with ESP-IDF

This project demonstrates how to show the carousel demo on an ESP32 S3 Box or an ESP32 S3 USB OTG stick. It has been tested and proven to work with these specific models.

## Prerequisites

Before you can run this example, make sure you have the following:

- An ESP32 S3 Box or  ESP32-USB-OTG stick.
- The Rust xtensa toolchain, which can be obtained from [esp-rs](https://github.com/esp-rs/). Use the installation instructions provided by [espup](https://github.com/esp-rs/espup#installation) to install it.
- The esp-idf SDK. The installation guide can be found at [esp-idf documentation](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/stable/esp32s3/get-started/index.html#installation).

## Running the Example

Once you have the prerequisites, navigate to either the `s3-box` or `s3-usb-otg` directory and execute the following command:

    . ${IDF_PATH}/export.sh
    idf.py build
    idf.py flash monitor

This will build the project, flash it to your ESP32 device, and open a monitor to view the output of the device.
