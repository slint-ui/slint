# GStreamer Example

This example application demonstrates a way to use gstreamer (with Rust bindings) to display a video stream in Slint.

Current Status:
* The code has so far only been tested on Ubuntu and Windows.

## Building and Running

You will need to have the gstreamer libraries used by gstreamer-rs installed.

https://gstreamer.pages.freedesktop.org/gstreamer-rs/stable/latest/docs/gstreamer/

On Debian/Ubuntu you can use:

```bash
$ apt-get install libgstreamer1.0-dev libgstreamer-plugins-base1.0-dev \
      gstreamer1.0-plugins-base gstreamer1.0-plugins-good \
      gstreamer1.0-plugins-bad gstreamer1.0-plugins-ugly \
      gstreamer1.0-libav libgstrtspserver-1.0-dev libges-1.0-dev
```

On Opensuse you can use:

```bash
$ zypper in zypper in gstreamer-plugins-bad-devel gstreamer-devel gstreamer-plugins-base-devel \
      gstreamer-plugins-good
```

On windows:
- Install gstreamer using [official binaries](https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/data/pkg/windows/) (we need to install both, e.g. `gstreamer-1.0-msvc-x86_64-1.24.11.msi` and `gstreamer-1.0-devel-msvc-x86_64-1.24.11.msi`), make sure to install full gstreamer in installer.
- And export it to path:
```bash
# For a UNIX-style shell:
$ export PATH="c:/gstreamer/1.0/msvc_x86_64/bin${PATH:+:$PATH}"

# For cmd.exe:
$ set PATH=C:\gstreamer\1.0\msvc_x86_64\bin;%PATH%
```


Once you have a working gstreamer-rs and slint install, `cargo run` should work.
