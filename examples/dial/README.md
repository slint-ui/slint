# Slint dial example

Work in progress Dial example. Uses Math.atan to calculate the angle and let the user rotate a dial.

# Planned changes

- [ ] Update and simplify the code by using the new Math.atan2 function.
- [ ] Lock the dial so it cannot be rotated between the blank start and end angles.
- [ ] Update the graphics slightly. They are 10 years old and would benefit from a small polish.
