### [`bash`](./bash)

Some examples of how to use the `sixtyfps-viewer` to add a GUI to shell scripts.

### External examples

* [Cargo UI](https://github.com/sixtyfpsui/cargo-ui): A rust application that makes use of threads in the background.

![Screenshot of Cargo UI](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sixtyfpsui/cargo-ui/master/screenshots/deptree.png "Cargo UI")

## Loading the example with the `viewer`

Simply load the .60 file with the viewer application

```sh
cargo run --release --bin sixtyfps-viewer -- examples/printerdemo/ui/printerdemo.60
```

## Running the Rust Examples

You can run the examples either by going into the rust sub-folder and use `cargo run`, for example:

```sh
cd examples/printerdemo/rust
cargo run --release
```

or you can run them from anywhere in the Cargo workspace by name:

```sh
cargo run --release --bin printerdemo
```

### Wasm builds

In order to make the wasm build of the example, you first need to edit the Cargo.toml
files to uncomment the line starting with `#wasm#` (or use the `sed` line bellow)
You can then use wasm-pack (which you may need to obtain with `cargo install wasm-pack`).
This will generate the wasm in the `./pkg` directory, which the `index.html` file will open.
Since wasm files cannot be served from `file://` URL, you need to open a wab server to serve
the content

```sh
cd examples/printerdemo/rust
sed -i "s/^#wasm# //" Cargo.toml
wasm-pack build --release --target web
python3 -m http.server
```

## Running the C++ Examples

* **When compiling SixtyFPS from sources:** If you follow the [C++ build instructions](/docs/building.md#c-build), this will build the C++
examples as well by default
* **From [installed binary packages](/api/cpp/README.md#binary-packages):** Simply run cmake in one of the example directory containing a CMakeLists.txt

 ```sh
 mkdir build && cd build
 cmake -GNinja -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH="<path to installed>" ..
 cmake --build .
 ```

## Running the Node Examples

You can run the examples by going into the node sub-folder and use `npm`, for example:

```sh
cd examples/printerdemo/node
npm install
npm start
```
